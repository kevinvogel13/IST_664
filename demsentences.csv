Party,Sentence
D,"Judge Schroeder, former governors, President Bennett, Speaker Flake, Senator Brown, Representative Loredo, honored guests, and my fellow Arizonans:

On this perfect Arizona day, in the company of my family, and surrounded by old friends and new colleagues, it is the greatest honor of my life to stand here as your twenty-first Governor."
D,"I would like to take a moment to thank our twentieth Governor, Jane Dee Hull, for devoting a quarter century of her life to public service."
D,"Governor Hull, throughout the transition we just completed, you could not have been more gracious and helpful."
D,Thank you.
D,"Today, a restless state looks on and wonders what will happen next."
D,"Weary of bad news and wary of more disappointment, citizens watch as we exchange one governor for another, one political party for another."
D,"With a mixture of hope and skepticism, Arizonans look on and ask: Will anything really change?"
D,"My friends, I say to you today we are already changing."
D,"The change we bring is exciting because in our quest to fix what is wrong with Arizona, we are re-discovering everything that is right with Arizona."
D,Our strength lies in our diversity and it lies in our heritage.
D,And we must draw on both of these gifts in the days ahead.
D,"Our diversity gives us a rich mix of cultures, faiths and traditions from across Arizonas communities and around the world."
D,Our heritage gives us its strength of character and its stubborn optimism.
D,"After all, we have built our modern cities and towns on the foundations first laid by the Hohokam, the Anasazi and the Mogollon peoples."
D,Our past thrives in our modern-day values of rugged independence and a can-do spirit.
D,Our diversity and our heritage define the vital Arizona I saw throughout my journey to this stage.
D,I saw it in the eyes of young Navajo children learning to use the Internet.
D,"I witnessed the determination of Spanish-speaking parents, learning English alongside their children in Yuma."
D,I saw it in the marvelous and artistic mosaics created by previously unemployed young adults at Las Artes in South Tucson.
D,"I have felt it among the growing ranks of entrepreneurs in our state, eager and willing to build a new economy."
D,And as the nation watched the seventh game of the World Series last year and the Fiesta Bowl last Friday it saw the simple essence of Arizona: this is a great place to live.
D,But I also saw another side of Arizona that we simply cannot wish away.
D,"I saw it through the eyes of the Sikh community after the murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi, the victim of a hate crime."
D,I saw it through the eyes of parents going to a food bank to get food for their children.
D,I still see it through the eyes of a homeless World War II veteran I pass each morning on my way to the Capitol.
D,"I see both sides of Arizona, and my goal is simple: We must ensure that prosperity wins over desperation and becomes the norm for all Arizonans."
D,"To do this, we must come back together as one, united in the knowledge that we need each other, and bound by our commitment to each other."
D,"My friends, we are all in this together."
D,We must lift this state out of its budget crisis without sacrificing education and the long-term future of Arizona.
D,"To accomplish this, we must change the political culture at this Capitol."
D,"With this inaugural, I declare an end to government where winners take all to the exclusion of everyone else."
D,"There is no room for this brand of politics in the new Arizona, and it will not be practiced in my office."
D,"As a testament to my firm belief that we need a new culture of cooperation, I have appointed a bipartisan administration."
D,"My team members reflect the diversity of our culture, and they represent the best thinking of all Arizonans."
D,"Next week a new Legislature will convene, and I will submit my plan to revitalize Arizona and balance our budget."
D,"Put simply, there are no painless solutions to our problems."
D,"To emerge from this quagmire, we need patience, discipline and a long-term vision of a new Arizona."
D,We are in the deepest financial crisis of our history.
D,"Our constitution, requires a balanced budget."
D,"But again must not balance our budget on the backs of children, as we have done too often."
D,I make this pledge: We will not mortgage our future to make up for the mistakes of the past.
D,"We must sacrifice short-term rewards and agendas, and keep our eyes on a larger prize a new Arizona where hope and opportunity abound."
D,"All of this will take time, patience and a willingness by all elected officials to challenge their own beliefs in search of a better ways to serve the people."
D,We cannot fix in a few months a crisis that was a decade in the making.
D,"Frankly, generations to come will not remember us for how we balanced the budget, or how we expanded or contracted the size of government."
D,"Instead, they will remember

How we educated our children."
D,How we protected our seniors.
D,How we built a new economy.
D,And how we made this wonderful state an even better place to live.
D,"We are building a new Arizona, and in doing so we are creating our own proud legacy of an Arizona that

Offers the best public education in America

Leads the world in research and product development, and

Boasts of prosperous and growing communities."
D,"My friends, we have what it takes to create that legacy."
D,To write our chapter of Arizona history.
D,"For today, I thank you for your confidence and trust in me."
D,I ask for your support and understanding as I embark on the task ahead.
D,I ask for your hand in partnership.
D,"Our future starts today, and what a beautiful day it is."
D,Thank you.
D,Thank you so much for joining me here today.
D,"First, thank you to my family – Annie, Emily, Lindsay, Teddy."
D,"As family, we always know we are in this together, and that is how I feel about all of you and the people of Connecticut – like an extended family."
D,"This includes our freshly minted constitutional officers, and our Lieutenant Governor Susan Bysiewicz."
D,"Thank you to our legislative leaders and our former chief justice Chase Rogers, who has been such a wise and close friend for many, many years."
D,"I am thankful that former governors Jodi Rell and Lowell Weicker are here: they have been in the arena, and to paraphrase my favorite President Teddy Roosevelt, the credit belongs not to the critic on the sidelines, but to the men and women in the arena."
D,"And to Dan Malloy who is retiring after decades of service to our state, and who has been so helpful in making the transition smooth and effective."
D,"Of course, my thanks to Nancy Wyman – we’ll be staying in close touch, I know."
D,"Lastly, I also want to thank the men and women of the Connecticut National Guard for their assistance coordinating today’s festivities and hosting us here in the State Armory."
D,"They are always there when the people of our state need them, and we thank them for their service."
D,"I asked Rabbi Goldman, Pastor Steel, Reverend Ahlberg, and Saud Anwar, all friends from different faiths to say a few words, reminding us that whatever our differences, we have so much more that holds us together than tears us apart."
D,"Many years ago, Reverend Ahlberg welcomed Annie and me and another couple to the non-denominational Round Hill Community Church in very Republican Greenwich."
D,"He introduced Alan, a Lutheran, Carrie, a Greek Orthodox, Annie, an Episcopalian, and Ned, a Democrat."
D,Now that’s diversity.
D,"From here, we march to the Capitol with the Foot Guard, who have been hosting the inauguration for 250 years, accompanied by Bridgeport’s Harding High School Marching Band."
D,"I was a volunteer teacher there many years ago, but I remember those kids like yesterday."
D,"As your governor, I will work tirelessly to ensure that all of our kids have the greatest opportunities to thrive, succeed, and create a life of their own, right here in Connecticut."
D,Susan and I recently joined a couple thousand high school students for a performance of Hamilton at the Bushnell.
D,"I talked to the kids about the meaning of the song “My Shot,” where Alexander Hamilton sings about himself as a scrappy immigrant kid with great opportunities, just like his new nation."
D,"That’s what I love about America; every generation we get a chance to reinvent ourselves, and every election gives us a fresh start."
D,"This is our chance to reinvent Connecticut – to think big, act boldly."
D,"On Election Day, thousands of voters waited for hours in the pouring rain."
D,"They believed that their vote would make a difference, and they were not going to throw away their shot – and neither are we."
D,"For generations, Connecticut was the most entrepreneurial, inventive, and fast-growing state loaded with amazing opportunities."
D,And we still can be.
D,I will not allow the next four years to be defined by a fiscal crisis.
D,"Together we will craft an honestly balanced budget which does not borrow from the future, but invests in the future."
D,"We owe all of our kids, our extended family, nothing less."
D,"In an hour, I speak to the legislature, in the room where it happens."
D,I will remind all of us that there is no room for the critic on the sidelines.
D,It is easy to vote no.
D,Let’s give each other the benefit of the doubt and work like heck to get to yes – and make sure that all of our kids get their shot.
D,Thank you for the faith you have instilled in me.
D,I will not let you down.
D,Now let’s get down to business.
D,God bless the great State of Connecticut.
D,I want to begin today by thanking my family.
D,"First, my partner, my best friend, the love of my life, and now the First Lady of Illinois, MK Pritzker."
D,My wonderful children Teddi and Donny.
D,I love you more than life itself.
D,"And my parents Sue and Don Pritzker, who departed this world too soon more than three decades ago but who left behind a set of values around honor and decency that will endure as long as there are good people in the world."
D,"And please join me in giving an ovation for my partner and your Lieutenant Governor, the incomparable Juliana Stratton."
D,"I want to acknowledge the other distinguished guests here today: Chief Justice Lloyd Karmeier, President John Cullerton, Speaker Michael Madigan, Leader Bill Brady, Leader Jim Durkin, Attorney General-elect Kwame Raoul, Secretary of State Jesse White, Comptroller Susana Mendoza, Treasurer Mike Frerichs, Members of the General Assembly, Members of the Congressional delegation, Governor Jim Edgar, Governor Pat Quinn, Governor Bruce Rauner, Governor Jim Thompson, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and National Guard Adjutant General Richard Hayes."
D,"To all of you, on behalf of the people of Illinois, thank you for your service."
D,"Ladies and gentlemen, for 200 years Illinois has proudly stood as the beating heart of our Republic… a place whose people have high hope and clear vision."
D,This is where Lincoln found the mettle to grip a warring nation in both hands and hold us together.
D,This is where Obama came to organize and to witness the courage that runs deep in our communities – in whom he found the fortitude to launch his bid to make history.
D,"This is where the 13th and 19th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution were first ratified, ending slavery and guaranteeing a woman’s right to vote."
D,"This is where, on the Sunday morning after the Great Chicago Fire, Reverend Robert Collyer, pastor of the First Unitarian Church, an immigrant, an ardent anti-slavery abolitionist, and a women’s suffrage advocate, stood amidst the broken ruins of his once grand church and brought hope and vision to his devastated congregation."
D,"His parishioners gathered around him, the sun peeking through gutted walls and splintered beams, an overturned column serving as his pulpit."
D,"His words that morning have survived the 147 years since he delivered them…a testament to their power and truth:

“What is lost?” he asked."
D,"“First, our homes."
D,"Second, our businesses."
D,But these are temporary.
D,… We have not lost our geography.
D,"Nature called the lakes, the forests, the prairies together in convention long before we were born, and they decided that on this spot a great city would be built."
D,… We have not lost our hope.
D,… The fire makes no difference to me.
D,"If you’ll stay here, I will."
D,"And we’ll work together, and help each other out of our troubles.”

Since Reverend Collyer’s time, Americans have often had to gather in broken cathedrals – some of stone and glass – some of aspirations and promises – to reaffirm our faith in one another."
D,We find ourselves at such a moment now.
D,"We contend every day with an economy that gives little and takes too much… that allows passion and work ethic to be overwhelmed by student loans, unexpected health emergencies and the rising cost of living."
D,"We want strong families, but we have yet to embrace more robust policies supporting paid parental leave and affordable child care that will sustain them."
D,We watch 100-year storms that now come every year – and yet we don’t allow the science of climate change to guide our decision making.
D,We fail to hold accountable leaders who sacrifice truth for personal gain – who substitute pageantry for patriotism.
D,We are a nation founded on fearless ideas – and yet we move away from those drawn to that vision.
D,"We want better roads, better schools, better wages – but we vilify anyone who dares suggest a workable path to those things."
D,"We allow our schools, our movie theaters, our hospitals, our neighborhoods to become battlefields – legally accessible by the weapons of war."
D,Our abdication of responsibility must end.
D,"Just a few weeks ago, I went to Mercy Hospital to attend a vigil honoring the victims of the murderous shootings there:

To honor the police officer who ran into gunfire and not away."
D,To honor the doctor – a University of Illinois graduate – who raised money for disadvantaged kids and led her church choir.
D,To honor the pharmacist who went into medicine because she had struggled with health problems herself.
D,These are the very best of Illinois.
D,"As a public servant, it’s hard to bear witness to violence such as this."
D,"But this job also exposes you to the people who stitch us back together time and again, to the Illinoisans who remind us what amazing capacity we have to change."
D,"At the Mercy Hospital vigil, Sister Barbara Centner read a Franciscan prayer that speaks to who we are in Illinois:

“May God bless us with tears to shed for those who suffer from pain, rejection, hunger, and war, so that we may reach out our hands to comfort them and turn their pain into joy."
D,"And may God bless us with enough foolishness to believe that we can make a difference in this world, so that we can do what others claim cannot be done, to bring justice and kindness to all our children and the poor.”

At 200 years old, Illinois is still a young promise."
D,Our time here has been but a blink.
D,"In 2019, we must begin a new century with new maturity…and enough foolishness to believe we can make a difference."
D,"That starts with leadership that abandons single minded, arrogant notions."
D,No.
D,Everything is not broken.
D,"Our history is a story of leaps forward and occasional stumbles back – and a promise renewed with each generation that we will try harder…that we will do better…that big breakthroughs are built of centuries of selfless effort by unheralded heroes …that big change rides on what we can do together, not what one person attempts alone."
D,Neighbors working side by side in Taylorville lost their homes and worldly possessions in the recent tornadoes.
D,They know that what Reverend Collyer said after the Great Chicago Fire was right – we work together to help each other out of our troubles.
D,"So today, with all the challenges Illinois faces, Democrats and Republicans will work together, and we must begin with our most basic responsibilities."
D,"We will propose, debate and pass a balanced budget this year."
D,"It won’t be easy, but let’s confront this challenge with honesty."
D,Our obligations as a state outmatch our resources.
D,Our fiscal situation right now is challenging.
D,And the solution requires a collective commitment to embracing hard choices.
D,We need to bring real efficiencies to state government.
D,Our information technology systems are outdated and cost more to maintain than they do to replace.
D,"Inexpensive healthcare prevention programs were decimated, causing higher spending to treat diseases that could have been cured."
D,Balancing the budget means lowering the cost of government while delivering the high quality services Illinoisans deserve.
D,"But be clear about this: I won’t balance the budget on the backs of the starving, the sick, and the suffering."
D,I won’t hollow out the functions of government to achieve an ideological agenda – I won’t make government the enemy and government employees the scapegoats.
D,Responsible fiscal management is a marriage of numbers – and values.
D,Which is why it’s time to start the earnest work of creating a fair tax system here in Illinois.
D,"Our regressive tax system, including property taxes and sales taxes, currently has the middle class paying more than double the rate the wealthy pay."
D,"That’s not fair, and it also doesn’t pay our bills."
D,Today our state’s fiscal instability affects every single person who lives and works in Illinois…whether you earn millions or the minimum wage.
D,"It means that our government wastes tens of millions of dollars paying higher interest rates than almost any other state, and we scare businesses and families away because they fear our uncertain future."
D,The current tax system is simply unsustainable.
D,Others have lied to you about that fact.
D,I won’t.
D,"The future of Illinois depends on the passage of a fair income tax, which will bring us into the 21st Century like most of our midwestern neighbors, and like the vast majority of the United States."
D,I’m not naïve about what it will take to do this.
D,All who enter a discussion about our state’s budget and a fair tax system in good faith will be welcomed to the table.
D,But if you lead with partisanship and scare tactics you will be met with considerable political will.
D,It is time to update and repair our state’s aging infrastructure.
D,"Railways, roads, bridges and fresh water arteries are on the verge of collapse."
D,Crumbling bridges mean people’s lives are in danger.
D,Deteriorating rail systems mean goods and services take longer to deliver and cost more.
D,We are the nation’s supply chain hub and we must be built like it.
D,Let’s remember too that an aging highway system is not just concrete and steel.
D,It’s a longer commute home.
D,It’s missing those golden hours between dinner and bedtime when your kids are young where you spend a few minutes reading a book together and talking about their day.
D,The seemingly dry acts of government really do affect the richness and joy of our lives.
D,We must treat the decisions we make together – the decisions of our elected officials to champion a cause and the decisions of our citizens to embrace or reject those efforts – with an eye to the pursuit of their happiness.
D,"As we enter Illinois’ third century, we must bring a renaissance to downstate Illinois which has been deprived of some basic resources for education and business building that are taken for granted elsewhere in our state."
D,"To begin, we will work to deliver high speed broadband internet coverage to everyone, in every corner of Illinois."
D,"Today every new job and every student is dependent upon connectivity, and no part of our state should be left out."
D,Our future depends upon our actions today.
D,"That’s why we must embrace a broad vision of environmental protection, or else decisions are going to be forced upon us in ways that will offer us little control and catastrophic outcomes for our children."
D,I believe in science.
D,"To that end, as one of my first acts as Governor, Illinois will become a member of the U.S."
D,"Climate Alliance, upholding the goals and ideals of the Paris Climate Accord."
D,Working men and women deserve to have a governor and a Department of Labor that will enforce laws protecting workers’ wages and workers’ rights.
D,And they deserve a $15 minimum wage.
D,It’s good for the working families of Illinois and good for our economy.
D,"As your governor, I’ll be committed to helping us become the fastest growing big state economy in the nation."
D,I will be our state’s best Chief Marketing Officer to attract jobs and businesses to Illinois.
D,"We will bring capital, technical assistance and mentorship to help Illinoisans across our state start and build new businesses and new jobs."
D,Our economic success depends upon it.
D,"In the interests of keeping the public safe from harm, expanding true justice in our criminal justice system, and advancing economic inclusion, I will work with the legislature to legalize, tax and regulate the sale of recreational cannabis in Illinois."
D,We will approach education with a holistic mindset – recognizing that students do best in community schools where teachers are paid well and where kids start learning at the earliest ages.
D,"And our economy grows when vocational training, community colleges and universities are strong."
D,We will do all of this with the most diverse set of voices and perspectives that Illinois has ever seen.
D,"I have built a cabinet of people who bring with them experiences I don’t share, from communities I did not come from, with expertise I don’t have, because to lead well, all of Illinois must be represented in the decision making."
D,"Furthermore, I want all the children of Illinois to see someone who looks like them in my government."
D,High hope and clear vision are what have built this state.
D,"Despite all the turmoil in this world, Illinoisans continue to build, innovate, create and dream."
D,"Our agriculture sector is built on some of the most fertile soil in the world, and it’s expanding, employing nearly a million people in every part of the state."
D,"We have nearly 13,000 manufacturing firms in Illinois that employ more than 580,000 people – many of them proud union workers with the best training in the world."
D,One out of 10 computer science degrees in the nation comes from Illinois colleges and universities.
D,"Our entrepreneurs continue to be tireless dreamers, whether it’s Jamie Gladfelter creating a software development incubator in Galesburg, Jeremie Draper shaping glass in Peoria or Leif Anderson still using his grandfather’s original recipes to make and sell candy in Richmond."
D,That’s the Illinois I see…one of possibility and promise.
D,"That’s the Illinois I know, one whose people are fearless and audacious."
D,That’s the vision I have for our state…another century of boundless opportunity.
D,"When your faith in this future flags, I urge you to remember Reverend Collyer and his ruined church – how he was the vessel for his parishioners’ burnt hopes."
D,How he saw the natural beauty of Illinois and knew nothing could steal that from them.
D,I see the natural beauty of Illinois every day – in our people.
D,More than anything else I see it in our capacity to be kind.
D,Consider the story a few weeks ago of Casey Handal and Zadette Rosado.
D,Casey and Zadette moved to Barrington last May and they proudly flew a rainbow flag behind their home.
D,"And then someone snuck into their yard and stole it, replacing their pride flag with an American flag – ironic because the thief doesn’t understand that you rob the American flag of meaning when you steal a person’s symbol of self-expression."
D,"That could have been the end of the story, but Casey and Zadette’s neighbor Kim Filian wouldn’t let it be."
D,She put a pride flag in her yard in solidarity.
D,And then she kept buying them because her neighbors kept asking for them too.
D,Soon there were pride flags everywhere – a place that hate had tried to fill was conquered by love instead.
D,"As Kim noted: “Frankly, I’ve grown weary of this, of all this hate."
D,"And I gotta say, it just seemed like there was one thing that I could do that I had control of.”

Remember that our ability to grow weary of hate fuels our enormous capacity to be kind."
D,"The bright moments of our past…the North Star of our future…are all lit not by ambition, partisanship or greed…but by kindness."
D,A willingness to be kind is a virtue often overlooked in life…a commitment to be kind in politics can change the world.
D,"Over a century ago, public policy grounded by kindness offered a penniless immigrant to Illinois a bed to sleep in, a public school education and the opportunity to succeed."
D,"130 years later, his great grandson just took the oath of office to be Governor of this great state."
D,"So thank you Illinois, for your faith in me."
D,I promise to live up to it every day.
D,"Together let’s go into this new century with enough faith to help each other out of our troubles, with enough foolishness to believe we can make a difference in the world, and with enough kindness to find the courage to change."
D,Thank you.
D,God bless the state of Illinois.
D,And God bless the United States of America.
D,My fellow Kentuckians: Our commonwealth is more than just a state.
D,It is a commitment.
D,A commitment to an idea and an ideal that we will come together for the common good of all people.
D,Together... common good.
D,The commitment to be that commonwealth for the common good is our north star.
D,It should lead and guide us.
D,"But just saying we are a commonwealth is not enough, for today it seems that we are further from realizing our commitment than ever."
D,"We not only teach our children that words matter, but that our actions speak just as loudly."
D,My hope is that together we can work to live the values we teach our children in both our words and our actions.
D,I intend to lead by example.
D,And I will strive to build an administration that does the same.
D,"As a people, we have succeeded when we have shared a common purpose."
D,When Kentucky came together to fix the injustice of our rape kit backlog – that was government at its best.
D,"Members of the legislative and executive branches, members of law enforcement, and our nonprofit community worked together to make sure that each and every rape kit from our historic backlog was tested."
D,And we continue to seek justice and closure for survivors and their families.
D,I hope that my legacy as attorney general will be never giving up.
D,"Every time we helped make an arrest or helped secure an indictment in a 20 or 30-year-old crime, we restored a little faith in our system and our government."
D,We showed we would never give up.
D,"As we sit here today, Kentucky is one of only a handful of states that has ended their historic backlog."
D,That’s the type of history we want to make for Kentucky.
D,One where we lead instead of lagging behind.
D,We succeed when we focus on our shared values; values that tie us together as Kentuckians and as Americans.
D,"We succeed when we put the collective interest, the common good, ahead of our personal ambitions."
D,"2 We succeed when we focus, right here in Kentucky, on making life better for our people instead of allowing national divisions to distract us from the work at hand."
D,We succeed when we stop treating each other as the enemy.
D,That is when we get government at its very best.
D,That is when we get Kentucky at its very best.
D,We have a chance right here and right now to get this right when so many others are getting it so wrong.
D,My faith teaches me to treat others with dignity and respect.
D,My faith also teaches forgiveness.
D,"That’s why on Thursday, I will sign an executive order restoring voting rights to over a hundred thousand men and women who have done wrong in the past but are doing right now."
D,They deserve to participate in our great democracy.
D,"By taking this step, by restoring these voting rights, we declare that everyone in Kentucky counts."
D,We all matter.
D,Americans have been disagreeing about things since the founding of our nation.
D,"Even the structure of our government creates conflict – but, it’s only when we view those who disagree with us as the enemy that our differences become irreconcilable or insurmountable."
D,Kentuckians have more in common – regardless of what party we belong to – than any national divisions can ever pull us apart.
D,We are on the same team.
D,"Here in Kentucky, we know a thing or two about winning teams."
D,We know that winning requires putting the team above oneself.
D,"Well, we’re all in this together on team Kentucky."
D,"Which means we have to begin looking at each other as teammates, as fellow Kentuckians, not as republicans and democrats - not as liberals and conservatives, not as rural or urban."
D,Because each of us is so much more than a letter or a label.
D,"We are wonderful, complex, flawed but amazing human beings, shaped by our families, our communities and our experiences."
D,"When we realize that, we will have the freedom to focus on what’s most important: making life better for our families."
D,All of our families.
D,That’s what being part of a commonwealth means to me.
D,"Striving together to lift one another up, to realize that we are better when we work together and we have the chance of bettering the lives of our friends and families and neighbors when we do so."
D,Those are real Kentucky values.
D,"It means helping our neighbors, no matter who they voted for."
D,3 It means treating everyone with dignity and respect.
D,No matter what party they belong to.
D,"As one of my first acts as governor-elect, I traveled to Clay County with Senate President Stivers, Senator McConnell and Attorney General-elect Daniel Cameron."
D,Together we opened a drug treatment facility.
D,Numerous members of the Clay County community attended.
D,"Some of the best conversations I had that day started with people telling me they didn’t vote for me, but now they were filled with hope, excited and now they are ready to work with me."
D,That they have hope.
D,I am now the governor of all the people of Kentucky.
D,I will be governor just as much for those who voted against me as those who voted for me.
D,Because I view this election as an opportunity...An opportunity to heal wounds.
D,An opportunity to work together instead of angling for political gain.
D,An opportunity to make room at the table for voices that have been excluded.
D,"One of those voices you just heard from, is Lt. Gov."
D,Jacqueline Coleman.
D,Not only is Jacqueline the first teacher to serve as Lt.
D,"Governor since Martha Layne Collins, she is the first Lt."
D,Governor to also serve as our Education Cabinet secretary.
D,Jacqueline has gone from being locked out to lieutenant governor.
D,"This morning, I reorganized the state board of education and appointed new members who support public education."
D,"These members were not chosen based on any partisan affiliation, but based on their commitment to make our schools better."
D,To put our children first.
D,"Today, for the first time, Kentucky’s teachers and educators led the inaugural parade."
D,Because they represent the best of us.
D,They are the ones on the front lines fighting to give our children the opportunity to succeed.
D,"They are the ones Muhammed Ali – a great Kentuckian – referred to when he said, ""Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth."""
D,"After this ceremony, the doors to this Capitol – your Capitol – will be open to all who wish to enter."
D,To help us celebrate our democracy and to remind all of us up here who we work for – you.
D,And every day I’m governor these doors will remain open to all Kentuckians.
D,No one will be locked out.
D,Because everybody counts.
D,"In the attorney general’s office, we worked hard every day to fight for the lost, the lonely and the left behind."
D,"For victims of child abuse, sexual assault and human trafficking... For seniors who were taken advantage of and for families worried about losing their health care."
D,For victims who needed someone to fight for them.
D,Leadership is not about doing what’s popular; it’s about doing what’s right.
D,"But above all else, it is about doing what is necessary for all of our people."
D,"To do that, we have to meet people where they are and work with those we disagree with."
D,While I cannot and will not promise to please all the people all the time – I can and will pledge to work with an outstretched hand.
D,"4 Twelve years ago, another Kentucky governor, in his inaugural address, quoted Thomas Jefferson saying, “Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.” I know that governor pretty well."
D,He’s sitting right over there.
D,"To Steve and Jane Beshear, I am grateful for your wisdom and passion for helping the people of our great state."
D,You have been wonderful parents.
D,"And, I am grateful for the greatest family anyone could have."
D,"Britainy, Will and Lila-you are my foundation, the core of who I am, and I love you with every part of my being."
D,Thank you.
D,"For my family and for all of our families, we need to work to find common ground because our challenges are many."
D,And solving them will not be easy.
D,Kentucky faces a critical shortage of teachers.
D,And far too many work a second job just to make ends meet.
D,Prioritizing our children also means prioritizing their teachers.
D,If Kentucky is to compete nationally – not to mention with our neighbors – we need to pay our teachers a living wage.
D,"We will start by including a $2,000 across-the-board raise in the budget we submit to the legislature."
D,"If our public schools – especially those in struggling communities– are going to survive and thrive, we need to make sure they are adequately funded."
D,"That means looking at class size, providing technology and striving to give every child true opportunity."
D,This is not a partisan issue.
D,This is a Kentucky issue.
D,The same goes for protecting the retirement of all our public employees.
D,"Kentucky’s educators, social workers, police officers, firefighters and other first responders keep their promise every day to serve, protect, rescue and educate."
D,We must keep our promise to them and their families.
D,This is not a partisan issue.
D,This is a Kentucky issue.
D,"When Kentucky expanded Medicaid, it provided four hundred thousand more of our fellow Kentuckians access to affordable health care."
D,These are our brothers and sisters.
D,We sit next to them in the stands on Friday and pray next to them in the pews on Sunday.
D,"After the expansion, these neighbors could go see a doctor without fear of bankruptcy."
D,And the expansion ensured that nearly all of Kentucky’s children had real access to health care.
D,I will honor and strengthen this commitment to our families...
D,I will do everything in my power to ensure that Kentuckians with pre-existing conditions do not lose their coverage.
D,And I will fight to lower the cost of prescription drugs and we’ll start with insulin.
D,Health care should not be a partisan issue.
D,Because health care is a Kentucky issue.
D,5 Kentucky is still 47th in the country in per capita income.
D,Let’s admit what that means.
D,Far too many of our families live in poverty.
D,"Worse, 22% of Kentucky children live in poverty."
D,That means nearly one quarter of our kids are never certain about their next meal or whether they’ll have a roof over their heads.
D,There is no easy solution and this is a bigger problem than any one governor can solve alone.
D,"As a start, we have to recognize that this is not just about the number of jobs."
D,And it’s not enough that the unemployment rate is low.
D,"That statistic doesn’t tell the story of families struggling to make ends meet with two, and sometimes three, jobs."
D,We must implement a comprehensive economic plan to create the better-paying jobs our families in need.
D,We need it desperately.
D,We owe that to our children.
D,"We can start by investing in agritech and advanced manufacturing, two areas where Kentucky is poised to be a national leader if we have the vision and the will to be bold."
D,"We all want Kentucky to be a place where our children and grandchildren want to – and can afford to raise their own children, keeping families together and growing our commonwealth."
D,For the common good.
D,"Daniel Boone once said, “Heaven must be a Kentucky kind of place.” He was right."
D,But we are now living in the most divisive period of our lifetime.
D,Today gives us a chance to get this right.
D,"To be a lighthouse in the storm, to be a beacon in the night."
D,"Today is a day to celebrate our history, our democracy and our freedom."
D,It is also a time to recommit to being a commonwealth for the common good.
D,We’re all on Team Kentucky.
D,Let’s prove to this country and to each other that we can get this right.
D,I can’t wait to get started.
D,Thank you.
D,God bless you and god bless the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
D,"My fellow Louisianans:

I am grateful to be here today and thankful to everyone who has traveled from Amite and other places near and far to join us for this ceremony."
D,"Governor Jindal, the first thing Donna and I want to do is thank you, Mrs. Jindal, and your staff for the efficient and gracious manner in which this transition has been handled."
D,Your kindness and cooperation is a testimony that we can indeed work together for the common good of the state we all love.
D,"Speaking of love, I want to thank the love of my life, my wife Donna, and our children Samantha Bel, Sarah Ellen, and John Miller."
D,"Also, I want to thank my mother, Dora Jean Edwards, and pay tribute to my late father Frank Edwards, Jr., who died while the campaign was underway."
D,"I miss him terribly and thank him for passing on to me a sense of service, commitment to others, and the value of hard work."
D,"I love my parents, siblings, and extended family and thank each of them for helping me stand before the state as Louisiana's Governor."
D,I especially want to thank all the people of Louisiana – those who have joined us here today and those spread out in each corner of the state.
D,We are here because you have chosen to rise above partisan politics and put Louisiana First.
D,"I was not a business-as-usual candidate, and I will not be a business-as-usual governor."
D,"I am, first and foremost, a proud Louisianan."
D,"Like many of you, I grew up in a family that taught me the importance of faith."
D,"We filled an entire pew at church every Sunday, and the hardest catechism teacher I ever had was my mother, who taught me in the sixth grade."
D,"Like many of you, I also grew up with a strong appreciation for the sportsmen’s paradise we live in."
D,Some of my best memories are of camping with my father and six brothers.
D,"Every year, we would float the Tangipahoa River to Manchac, eating whatever we caught or killed along the way."
D,"But just in case we came up empty, we’d always bring along some sweet potato pie left over from Thanksgiving."
D,And my favorite memories are those spent sitting around the campfire on cold nights in discussion and debate with my family.
D,"In Louisiana, our land is diverse, our ideas are diverse, and our people are diverse."
D,"From the original Native American inhabitants to the French, Spanish, Acadians and Africans...

From the Yugoslavian oyster harvesters to the Sicilian strawberry farmers... Nearly every nation on earth has left its imprint on our culture."
D,"Louisiana is an example to the rest of the country that diversity is a source of strength, not division."
D,That is why I am confident that regardless of party we can band together to rebuild Louisiana.
D,The status quo is not sustainable in a state that is anything but ordinary.
D,"As we prepare to meet the mounting challenges ahead, I am reminded of General MacArthur’s farewell address to West Point that duty, honor and country should be rallying points “to build courage when courage seems to fail; to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith; to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.”

My experience at West Point and my service as an army officer have molded the way I look at the world."
D,"Ever since Athens defeated Sparta over 2,500 years ago, and the history of that war was written, military officers have been trained to look at every challenging task in a three step process."
D,The first step is gathering all the information you can about the job at hand.
D,The second step is to ask yourself - and knowledgeable people around you - what are our options to successfully address the challenge and which ones best fit our mission and values.
D,That’s the choice of a strategy.
D,"And finally, step three is a decision on tactics."
D,How are we going to get it done?
D,"In military terms, victory is won by information (or intelligence), strategy and tactics."
D,THAT is how I propose we proceed in our shared mission of putting Louisiana First.
D,We must be honest with ourselves and one another.
D,"I can tell you I'd rather be here today inheriting a billion dollar surplus, than a $1.9 billion shortfall, but there isn’t a challenge we won’t meet."
D,"We must be grounded in reality and see the facts as they are, not as we want them to be."
D,"First, we need to acknowledge the harsh truths about poverty in our state."
D,"We talk a lot about our abundant natural resources, but we need to talk more about the most precious natural resource God has entrusted to us - our children."
D,"In Louisiana, 1 in 4 school- aged children live in poverty."
D,That’s unacceptable and it MUST change.
D,It’s unacceptable when a parent’s hard work isn’t enough to pay the bills or go to a doctor.
D,I’ve traveled from Algiers to Zwolle and met countless single mothers working for minimum wage behind a cash register at a gas station.
D,"Often, it’s one of several jobs they have, and they still battle to make ends meet."
D,"The faces are different, but their struggles are the same."
D,"On top of not paying our workers a living wage, women in Louisiana make an average 66 cents on the dollar compared to men."
D,We are the worst state in the union for pay equity.
D,That is unacceptable.
D,"Not just for my daughters, but for all women."
D,"Second, we’ve somehow forgotten that education is synonymous with opportunity."
D,"In the past 7 years, we’ve cut funding for higher education by 700 million dollars – the largest disinvestment in the country – putting campuses on the brink of bankruptcy, and sending many of our best and brightest students out of state."
D,"Tuition increases, also the highest in the nation, have priced many students out of their dreams and are making TOPS unsustainable."
D,"For K through 12 education, while we've had some improvements, we rank 49th
in academic achievement."
D,"And while our high school graduation rate is at an all-time high, we still fall below the national average."
D,"Last, but certainly not least, we face a daunting fiscal crisis."
D,"We can no longer afford to lurch from year to year, cobbling together temporary fixes and expecting to realize permanent sustainability."
D,"If we don’t fix the structural budget deficit, we can’t fix any of our other problems."
D,Those are the facts.
D,"We are one of the richest states in cultural and natural resources, yet our performance lags in almost every critical category."
D,There is a lot of serious work ahead of us.
D,"As Lincoln put it, “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate for the stormy present.”

We are here because the people of Louisiana believe we can do better."
D,"By doing better, we will be better than these rankings suggest."
D,And we are not going to let you down.
D,"This mission is critical, and here are some of the strategies I propose."
D,We must make it possible for all Louisiana citizens to be healthy and prosperous.
D,"So as promised, tomorrow I am going to accept the federal funding to expand Medicaid so that working families in Louisiana can get access to healthcare."
D,Your tax dollars should not be going to one of the 30 other states that have expanded Medicaid when WE are one of the states that expansion will help the most.
D,"We should make a modest, but meaningful, increase to the minimum wage and the legislature should finally pass effective equal pay so that women, the economic leaders of many households, get the same pay for the same work."
D,We know that when women do well – children prosper too.
D,This is the very definition of family values.
D,"Next, we need to treat our educators with the respect they deserve and demand the best for our children."
D,It’s been proven time and again that a more educated and trained workforce is our greatest long-term economic generator.
D,So we MUST make college more affordable.
D,We can start by ending double digit tuition hikes.
D,We cannot fund higher education on the backs of our students.
D,Our state should support our public higher education institutions.
D,"We must also increase need- based aid for students ready to enroll in colleges across Louisiana,

and work towards a goal of funding higher education at 50% state support and at 50% tuition and fees."
D,"In K through 12 education, we need to promote challenging, Louisiana standards and curriculum, maintain a meaningful accountability system and end the overuse of costly standardized testing."
D,"We should also enhance and protect local control of public education so that taxpayers,
voters, and local school boards are empowered to oversee the financial and educational decisions that impact the success of our children."
D,"And finally, our top priority must be stabilizing the budget."
D,"While all options are on the table, we’re going to make strategic budget reductions, increase efficiencies, accept OUR federal tax dollars back, and rework the failed system of tax incentives, credits and rebates, which bleed the state’s revenue and, too often, leave little to show for the spending."
D,"Now, how are we going to make this happen?"
D,"By partnering with the legislature, business and industry, local governments, educators, stakeholders and working people all across this state."
D,"By calling on the kind of discipline, steel-eyed focus, and determination to succeed... by moving ONWARD."
D,"I can’t do it alone, and the enormous challenges we face will not be resolved overnight."
D,"But together, we will accomplish our mission."
D,Now is the time for full participation.
D,"I am calling on the legislature to work with me and pass sound solutions, and I’m calling on the people of Louisiana to constructively engage and share your thoughts and ideas."
D,"It will be hard work, and it will take sacrifice."
D,But it can be done.
D,It MUST be done.
D,"You can expect the unvarnished truth from this administration regarding the challenges we face, the solutions we propose, and the opportunities we seek."
D,The breeze of hope that got us here today will also drive a current of change as mighty as the Mississippi.
D,But this river can’t flow unless the breeze continues.
D,"We must put action before idleness, unity before party, and citizenship before self in order to put Louisiana first."
D,"Like you, I’ve been here through good times and bad."
D,"We are not a perfect state, but we are a resilient one."
D,"Following shared sacrifice, there WILL be shared prosperity."
D,I am bullish on our future.
D,"Louisiana’s best days are certainly ahead, and I want you to be as excited and optimistic as I am."
D,"Remember, after Katrina we battled back and, in fact, we still celebrated Mardi Gras."
D,"After the Red River flooded, families still gathered at the state fair."
D,"After the oil spill, we didn’t give up fishing for oysters and shrimp."
D,The sugar cane still grows in Louisiana.
D,Tourists still flock to the French Quarter.
D,And new industries continue to emerge.
D,If there are two things we’ll never run out of in Louisiana – it’s gumbo and gumption.
D,The people of Louisiana want and deserve a state government as hopeful as they are.
D,I pledge to you that we will deliver on that hope.
D,"As Solomon prayed, “So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong.” That will also be my prayer."
D,I spent nearly three years traveling this state asking for your votes and your prayers.
D,"Today, I simply ask for your support and your prayers for me and for this state."
D,"From the bottom of my heart, I cannot thank you enough for this incredible opportunity."
D,"God bless you all, God bless the Great State of Louisiana and God bless the United States of America."
D,"Madam Chief Justice, Mr. President, Madam Speaker, members of the 129th Legislature, members of the state and federal judiciary, former Governors, Tribal chiefs, members of the military, friends, and family, honored guests, and those 4,346 friends of mine on Facebook!"
D,I also draw your attention to the empty seat in the military section which honors and recognizes all Maine Service members currently deployed.
D,It is with humility and gratitude that I stand before you this evening.
D,I welcome you to a ceremony that represents both a change in the individual who occupies the office of the Chief Executive and the peaceful passing of the torch of progress.

There are many in this state who are “the unsung” as poet Wes McNair has called them."
D,"They are the firefighters and teachers, the techies and hotel workers, the farmers and fishermen, the waiters and loggers, and the barbers and millworkers of our towns."
D,"They are our friends, our neighbors."
D,They are immigrants.
D,Laborers.
D,Veterans.
D,People with disabilities.
D,People from away.
D,People we rely on every day.
D,And many who rely on us.
D,This governorship is about them — the men and women of Maine.
D,"This year, for the first time in our state’s 198-year long history, after 74 men from York, Cumberland, Penobscot, finally you have elected a governor… from Franklin County!"

I am from the foothills of Maine, which bred Margaret Chase Smith and Carrie Stevens."
D,"And Cornelia Crosby — known as Fly Rod Crosby — who became Maine’s first registered guide in 1897, and who famously said, “I would rather fish any day than go to heaven.”

In recent weeks I have received many letters."
D,"Eight-year old Lucy wrote, “Now I feel like I could become governor someday!”

The morning after the election, one mother left a note in her daughter’s lunchbox, “Janet Mills won last night!” it said."
D,“She is the FIRST woman to be the governor in Maine EVER!
D,Think about all the things you can do!
D,"love, Mom.”

I do think about all the things they can do, along with their brilliant brothers, uncles and fathers."
D,"But truly, this year’s milestone will one day be commonplace, like drinking milk or eating toast."
D,"When future generations read of this day, they will wonder what the fuss was about."
D,Sometimes our culture moves slowly in the stream of change.
D,"Streams, like the people of Maine, change direction on occasion to find the best way forward."
D,"Many days I awake to see the mist rising from the Sandy River as it steers its course to the Kennebec, the winter’s breath unveiling a new day in my hometown, a new day in this state."
D,"Then I hear the familiar sounds of chickadees, church chimes and Jake brakes."
D,This is home in Maine.
D,"The Sandy River pours out of Rangeley Lake, meanders through town, and gains momentum on its way to the Kennebec."
D,"There it joins other tributaries to become a powerful waterway, a loud home to eagles and salmon, stripers and sturgeon, on its course to Merrymeeting Bay."
D,The Sandy River connects my town to those up and downstream.
D,"We become one with the rest of Maine, linked by water, woods, and land."
D,"Former Governor Joshua Chamberlain described this link back in 1876:

“This great and wide sea…these beaches and bays and harbors…these things invite the brave, the noble…Thought comes here and dwells…They will love the land, and the land will give back strength.”

The Wabanaki people know this bond."
D,"Their wisdom was passed along by people like Joseph Attean, legendary Governor of the Penobscot nation, a brave, open-hearted and forbearing individual, who guided Henry David Thoreau in his first moose hunt, through the vast and primitive wilderness to Chesuncook Lake."
D,"The plaque that overlooks Attean Lake — named for him – reads,

“Rise free from care, before the dawn, and seek adventure.”

Today we rise, a new day before us, and seek adventure."
D,But today our connection to the land is endangered.
D,"After 80 years of studies warning that carbon emissions are destroying our environment, the danger is now at our doorstep."
D,"The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than almost any other saltwater body in the world, driving our lobsters up the coast."
D,"Our coastal waters are growing acidic; temperatures are fluctuating, and sea levels are rising, endangering our shellfish industry."
D,Our forests are less suitable for spruce and fir and more suitable for ticks.
D,"Climate change is threatening our jobs, damaging our health and attacking our historic relationship to the land and sea."
D,"Tonight I say, enough."
D,"Enough with studies, talk, and debate."
D,It is time to act!
D,"Our new Administration will embrace clean energy; change our modes of transportation; weatherize homes and businesses, and reach a goal of 50 percent of our electricity coming from Maine renewable resources."
D,"These actions will create good-paying jobs, preserve our environment, and welcome young people to build a green future here in Maine."
D,"And, by the way, when you drive by the Blaine House in the next few weeks, look for the new solar panels that we are going to install!"
D,We need a healthy environment.
D,And we need healthy people.
D,Maine voters agree – which is why they voted to expand Medicaid.
D,"Hospitals, nurses, doctors and businesses all agree as well."
D,"Health care is for everyone, not just the well to do."
D,It is for the small businesses struggling to pay high health insurance bills.
D,"It is for the family on the brink of bankruptcy because of one illness, accident or medical mishap."
D,It is for the community that takes up collections in a jar at the corner store to pay for a neighbor’s medical costs.
D,It is for people like Patty.
D,"My friend Patty was a vibrant, intelligent and charitable woman, an athlete, a mother of three wise children, loved by all… and uninsured."
D,"She died needlessly from breast cancer, a disease that could have been diagnosed early, treated, and cured."
D,Patty’s story is not unique.
D,Many of you have friends like Patty.
D,It is unacceptable.
D,"In the memory of Patty and thousands of others, our new Administration will expand Medicaid – and pay for it sustainably; work to ensure that every person has primary care; control the cost of health insurance; and rein in the cost of prescription drugs."
D,A major part of the health care crisis is the opioid epidemic.
D,History will note that we have abandoned an entire generation of people to this preventable disease.
D,"The allure of opiates can fill a hole in the human heart caused by loneliness, stress, and hopelessness."
D,"Even as I speak, there is someone within the sound of my voice about to consume a deadly drug, jeopardizing themselves, their friends, their families, and their communities."
D,"If that person is listening, please know that I–and many others — are here for you."
D,You are not alone.
D,We will confront this disease together.
D,"We will offer a helping hand, not pass judgment."
D,"We want you to survive, to succeed."
D,We want to welcome you home again.
D,"It is time for action — Narcan widely available, medication assisted treatment, recovery coaches."
D,These things will be a reality.
D,"And in sad memory of the 418 Maine people who lost their lives to drug overdose in 2017, our Administration will create a Director of Opiate Response, a person who will marshal the collective power and resources of state government to stem the tide of this epidemic

Part of that effort will be to fully engage with people in our own communities — to “take it outdoors,” as one of our favorite retailers puts it, renewing a healing bond we have with the land."
D,"In addition to protecting the medical health of our people, we will also advance the economic health of our people."
D,"To employers, entrepreneurs and innovators, with new ideas for forest products, aquaculture, recreation, renewables, and everything in between, I say, “You are welcome here!”

We will develop a world-class workforce."
D,Fewer than half of Maine adults now hold a postsecondary credential – either a college degree or a professional certification.
D,Yet two out of three jobs require such credentials.
D,"This imbalance is why we have – at the same time —employers saying they can’t find workers, and workers saying that they are stuck in dead-end jobs."
D,Education is the key to helping our people achieve their full potential.
D,Attracting talented young people to move here and make Maine their home will be a top priority of my Administration.
D,"From now on, a sign will greet all those arriving in our state at the Kittery line."
D,"It will say, quite simply: “Welcome Home.”

I will work with the new Legislature to achieve the best education for our people, from preschool through college and beyond, beginning with full and fair funding for schools, including our Career and Technical Centers."
D,And we will treat our teachers with the respect and dignity they deserve.
D,There is no higher priority than our children.
D,"And with so many young people at Long Creek, with children waiting for critical mental health services, and some even losing their lives to violence in their own homes, it is high time we put children’s health and safety first."
D,"I will start with one simple step — calling together the Children’s Cabinet for the first time in years, to tackle these issues."
D,These are the challenges we know about.
D,But we must also be prepared for the unexpected.
D,We know that a recession is possible in the next few years.
D,"We know that someday, robots, drones, driverless cars, broadband, and 3-D printing, will radically alter the way Maine people live, learn, and work."
D,We need to be ready.
D,I made my own predictions back at the turn of the century.
D,"In the year 1999, I wrote down in a journal a list of what I thought would change and what I thought would stay the same in the new millennium."
D,"I predicted that in 50 years there would no longer be the following things: cash, paper bags, spare tires, lint, dust, or panty hose."
D,"But in 50 years I said there would likely still be: Stephen King bestsellers, Baxter State Park, people from away, and … Strom Thurmond."
D,"As you can see, I cannot rely on myself to predict the future."
D,That’s why I am enlisting help.
D,"I am following the advice of writer Kurt Vonnegut, who said “Every government ought to have a Department of the Future.”

And so my administration will create an Office of Innovation and the Future."
D,"This office will dive into major policy challenges, foster collaboration and propose concrete, workable solutions."
D,Now here’s how I want to govern.
D,We are all in this together.
D,We all want Maine to have a beautiful environment; happy people; and prosperous communities.
D,"Though we all agree on the goal, we differ about how to get there."
D,"We are Republicans, Greens, Democrats, Libertarians, Independents, and many more besides."
D,This is something I know well myself.
D,"I mean, every Mills family reunion is like a meeting of the United Nations – everyone has an opinion and wants a microphone."
D,But these differences are what make my family strong.
D,They make every family strong.
D,They make Maine strong.
D,Our diversity is a virtue – one that we should harness to advance good public debate and good public policy.
D,"We welcome the voices of newcomers to the public conversation — the young, immigrants, people of different cultures, people of color, people of different orientations."
D,All are important members of the Maine family.
D,"My town has always had a commons, where everybody could graze their sheep and cattle, sell produce and where we would enjoy a concert on a summer evening."
D,"Now our state must find its own common ground, expand our horizons and become one Maine again."
D,"From the tree streets of Lewiston to the rolling fields of the County, from the Bold Coast to the Height of Land, from Cross Rock in Allagash to Portland’s Promenades, our people will once again find unity of purpose."
D,"We will bring back Maine’s tradition of civil discourse, expressed by Governor Israel Washburn, a friend of Abraham Lincoln’s, in his 1861 inaugural:

“Waving aside petty schemes and unseemly wrangles…let us rise, if we can, to the height of the great argument which duty and patriotism so eloquently address to us.”

You know, I have fallen in love a few times in my life."
D,And there are those in this audience whom I have loved for long and for years including friends and family and some newly loved.
D,"But it is the bond we all share for our state, for children longing for security, for newcomers seeking to belong, for all of those who feel left behind, who long for respect and dignity."
D,One thing we all love is our great state.
D,"And when a family, a community, a state believe in each other, help each other, love each other, great things can happen."
D,Maine people have greatness within them.
D,Maine is our home.
D,"We are connected by the rivers and the land, the forests and the mountains."
D,We are connected by love.
D,We are strengthened by our connections.
D,"We are one Maine, undivided, one family from Calais to Bethel, from York to Fort Kent."
D,"We meet this evening, free from care, the heirs of Joseph Attean, Joshua Chamberlain, Fly Rod Crosby, and Israel Washburn."
D,"Tomorrow we rise before the dawn — like the mist over the Sandy River — and seek adventure, with hope in our hearts and love in our souls for the brand-new day."
D,"To all of you, and to the people of Maine, I say, Welcome Home."
D,Welcome Home.
D,Thank you.
D,"Faculty and administration; reverend clergy, students and graduates; distinguished guests, and most importantly, President Bottomly and her family."
D,Today we celebrate the wisdom of Wellesley College.
D,I’m happy to be here to welcome President Bottomly to the world-class educational community in this commonwealth.
D,"She has excelled in each step along her path to this milestone, especially in her work to expand opportunities to women in higher education, for students as well as faculty members."
D,Wellesley College is wise indeed to have placed her at the helm.
D,She is absolutely the right choice to steward this college into its next era of achievement and growth.
D,"For our commonwealth, her leadership could not come at a more important time."
D,In these times we are facing unprecedented challenges.
D,"Graduates are entering into a global economy where the skills and talents of our graduates today will be measured against those of graduates not just in Raleigh and San José, but in Shanghai and Bangalore as well."
D,"Both China and India are turning out qualified engineers at extraordinary rates, building and securing the foundations for economic and educational competitiveness for generations."
D,And China has plans to build a university the scale and capacity of UCLA every year for the next ten years.
D,"Our ambition is not just to adjust to this fundamental change, but to lead it."
D,"Our colleges and universities, public and private, must continue to be engines of economic growth and social justice."
D,They must continue to drive innovation in science and the arts.
D,And they must continue to cultivate the highly skilled talent that – as leaders from both here and overseas constantly confirm – is our calling card around the world.
D,"Since its founding 138 years ago, Wellesley College has earned its place in that tradition of excellence."
D,"Today students continue to advance and succeed, capitalizing on all that this commonwealth and this institution have to offer in brainpower and innovative spirit."
D,"Wellesley brings new possibilities to young women, fostering civic engagement and a culture of opportunity in the community and our commonwealth."
D,I am confident in our ability to meet our challenges because I have confidence in our people.
D,President Bottomly’s leadership ensures a very bright future for this institution and all that it contributes to our commonwealth.
D,I value your work and look forward to your continuing partnership.
D,Congratulations.
D,"My friends, my family, my fellow Michiganders: 

It is an incredible honor to address you as the 49th governor of the great state of Michigan."
D,I would not be here today without my family.

Thank you for being by my side on this journey and for inspiring me every day."
D,I love you so much.
D,"I am honored to be joined this morning by Governors Snyder, Granholm, and Blanchard."
D,"If the Spartans weren’t on the West Coast and if Governor Milliken were able, there’s no question that he and Governor Engler would be here, too."
D,Each knows the incredible opportunity in  - and sacrifice of - holding this office.
D,Thank you for your service and you attendance today.
D,"As I reflect on the monumental task that lies ahead, another one of my predecessors comes to mind."
D,"Over 60 years ago, Governor G. Mennan Williams - aka “Soapy” Williams – a Democrat – worked with a Republican legislature to build the Mackinac Bridge."
D,"At the time, many people believed building a suspension bridge that long was not possible."
D,Others thought the politicians would not be able to put their differences aside to get it done.
D,"They even called it “Soapy’s Folly.” 

But together, leaders from both parties, and workers from across the state, proved them all wrong."
D,"And in November 1957, against the odds, the Mighty Mac opened."
D,It connected our peninsulas AND our people.
D,It strengthened our economy.
D,"And most of all, it sent a powerful message to the world: Don’t ever bet against Michigan."
D,"In the spirit of that great legacy, I want to recognize the incoming legislative leadership – Senate Majority Leader Shirkey; Senate Democratic Leader Ananich; House Speaker Chatfield; and House Democratic Leader Greig – and all of the members of the legislature who are with us today."
D,I look forward to working with you in the coming weeks and months.
D,"We may belong to different parties, but we are all here for the same reason."
D,"We are proud Michiganders, first and foremost."
D,And we owe it to the people we serve to cast partisanship aside.
D,To roll up our sleeves.
D,To build bridges together.
D,"I feel lucky to have called Michigan home, my whole life."
D,I grew up in Grand Rapids.
D,I learned to value community and hard work.
D,I got a world-class education at Michigan State in East Lansing.
D,And law school in Detroit.
D,"And then I moved back to East Lansing, near my family."
D,I always knew I would raise my family here.
D,"Because to me, Michigan is more than a place."
D,It’s a way of life.
D,Up North and the lakes in summer.
D,Football in the fall.
D,Hunkering down at home in the winter.
D,Or at the capitol with thousands of your close friends!
D,And thawing out in the spring .
D,.
D,.
D,if we’re lucky.
D,We love our 4 seasons.
D,We’re proud of our traditions.
D,"Of course, what truly makes Michigan special are the people who call it home."
D,"Our diverse cultures, backgrounds, and experiences that strengthen the fabric of our communities – from paczki to pasty… and from miner to motorhead."
D,"And whether you live in Gogebic County, Grosse Ile or Grand Rapids, all Michiganders share some common traits that are part of the legacy we’ve inherited in the state we call home."
D,Grit.
D,Humility.
D,Dreaming up something new.
D,Building it with our own two hands.
D,That’s how we became a hotbed of innovation and created music that moved the world.
D,"It’s why Michigan will be forever associated with names like Reuther, Ford, and Aretha."
D,"And it’s why, a century after we led a global manufacturing revolution, we still have the best workforce on the planet – from our farmers and factory workers, to our incredible state employees, who work tirelessly every day to keep Michigan going strong."
D,There’s no place in the world like Michigan.
D,No people like Michiganders.
D,And no question that Michigan has as much God-given potential as any place on Earth.
D,"But while potential is universal, opportunity is not."
D,"And right now, in Michigan, too few have the opportunity they deserve."
D,"That’s not easy to admit, but we have to be clear-eyed about the challenges we face."
D,Now is the time to confront our problems head-on and say – in one voice – let's get it done.
D,"Over the past year, as I traveled the state and listened to people’s concerns, the same issues came up over and over and over again."
D,"My campaign slogan got a lot of attention, but I didn’t come up with it."
D,"It was a working mom I met at a hospital in Detroit who told me, “Gretchen, I just want you to fix the damn roads.” 

I heard similar messages from people in all 83 counties."
D,"I heard the same thing from Republicans, Democrats, and Independents."
D,"We might live in divisive times, but Michigan’s problems are not partisan problems."
D,Potholes are not political.
D,Neither is clean water.
D,Or better skills.
D,Or great schools for our kids.
D,I will be a governor for everyone.
D,And I am committed to working across party lines to ensure that all Michiganders have opportunity.
D,That means rebuilding our roads and bridges.
D,Cleaning up our water.
D,And ensuring that everyone gets the education and skills they need to compete for good-paying jobs.
D,These issues affect us all.
D,"These things are the foundation of secure families, strong communities, and a more prosperous state."
D,None of us can afford to compromise Michigan’s economic future because we won’t compromise with one another.
D,"Divided government makes solving problems harder, but not impossible."
D,"We need to come together now – not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Michiganders."
D,"So, let’s fix our roads, and be the state that’s not paralyzed by partisanship, but works together."
D,And create the blueprint for rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure.
D,"Let’s show the rest of the country how to solve America’s literacy crisis, and show them what good government actually looks like."
D,And let’s build a stronger Michigan that is – once again – a center of economic opportunity and mobility for people around the world.
D,I’m not saying it's going to be easy.
D,Many will question whether we can protect our families and bolster our economy by fixing those damn roads.
D,They may not believe we have the ingenuity to solve the literacy crisis.
D,"And no doubt, some are betting against our ability to close the skills gap."
D,"But we are up to it, Michigan."
D,We have always defied the odds.
D,"And we are going to do it again, together."
D,We are going to prove that our shared future is more powerful than the issues that divide us.
D,"If we put our differences aside and get to work, we will come back stronger than ever."
D,"At a time when too many people want to separate us by building walls, we here in Michigan are going to get back to building bridges together."
D,The story of the Mackinac Bridge reminds us that we can do great things when we work together.
D,I know I didn’t get here on my own.
D,"I’m here because, over the past year, the people of Michigan showed up."
D,"At town halls, at rallies, and in record numbers on Election Day."
D,I am so grateful that you did.
D,But our work is just beginning.
D,"That’s why, today, I’m asking you to keep showing up."
D,Keep showing your passion for our state – and demanding action from our leaders.
D,"And let’s join forces, as Michiganders, to build bridges together… 

Over waters."
D,Between parties.
D,And to a brighter future for all.
D,Let's get to work Michigan!
D,Thank you.
D,"Madame Speaker, Mr. President, Madame Chief Justice, honorable members of the House and Senate and Executive Council, former Governors, our honorable United States Senator my fellow citizens:

Thank you for the trust you have placed in me, it humbles me and will sustain me as I work to lead our remarkable state."
D,"Today, as I was sworn in as your governor, I pledged to follow the constitutions of New Hampshire and of the United States."
D,"Now, I will make one more promise: I will work as hard as I can to honor your trust."
D,"And I will strive to do so in the tradition that has guided us throughout our history: the tradition of openness, bipartisanship, and collective problem solving."
D,"No one has exemplified that tradition more than the person I am succeeding, someone I want to thank on behalf of all of our citizens for his four terms in the Corner Office—thank you, Governor John Lynch."
D,"I sought this office so that we could shape our own way forward, harnessing the promise of our great citizen democracy to preserve and strengthen our state’s special qualities."
D,"I know that, together, we can build a stronger, more innovative New Hampshire, a New Hampshire where all of our citizens are included in our shared success and prosperity."
D,"To our very core, we value freedom, independence, hard work, fiscal responsibility, family and community."
D,We live these values in our personal lives and in our workplaces.
D,"And every citizen, regardless of circumstance, should have the opportunity to live them too – to hold a good job, work hard, raise a family, and share in the high quality of life we enjoy in New Hampshire."
D,"When they do, they become empowered and our state grows stronger."
D,"Our ability to accomplish this goal lies in our willingness to innovate – not only to develop innovative new products and services, but to innovate in other areas as well: in the operation of our traditional industries, in the way we educate our citizens, in the way we deliver government’s essential services, and in providing the tools that support growing businesses and create good middle-class jobs."
D,New Hampshire has many distinctions we can be proud of.
D,We have the lowest poverty rate and lowest teen birth rate in the country.
D,We are consistently rated as one of the safest states and one of the best places in the country to raise children.
D,We are uniquely suited to seize the promise and opportunity that innovation presents.
D,"But adapting to the demands of an innovation economy presents immediate challenges, too."
D,"Our population is aging, yet we pursue policies that are driving our young people out of the state."
D,We have the fourth highest in-state tuition for public universities in the country and too many of our talented students pursue a college education elsewhere.
D,"When these New Hampshire natives complete school, they often choose not to return, depriving our economy of talented people with the energy and skills needed to drive innovation."
D,"We need to renew our tradition of attracting new citizens to our state, and we need to help our young people stay here, raise their own families here, and remain part of the future of New Hampshire."
D,Cutting state support for public education in half while lowering the tobacco tax two years ago was short sighted.
D,"It hurt our young people and, if not quickly addressed, will impair our future economic prosperity."
D,We must begin to reverse course.
D,"In exchange, the University System, working with us, needs to increase the number of New Hampshire students admitted to our state colleges and universities and freeze in-state tuition."
D,"We must also recognize that not every student chooses the same path, and that our community college system has developed innovative, nimble and cutting edge programs to educate our citizens."
D,We must continue to support their efforts to build the strong workforce that our businesses need.
D,I have always strongly believed in the power and value of education.
D,"My parents were educators and I was fortunate that they worked to make sure that my sister, brother and I received the best educations possible."
D,"Mom and Dad created a home in which the value of learning, the obligations of citizenship, and vigorous but respectful debate were emphasized."
D,Our home was always warm and rarely dull; it is difficult for me to express how grateful I am to my parents and family.
D,"I am so glad that my mother, Peggy, my sister Franny, and my brother Frank are here today."
D,"Given the importance of education in my life, it’s probably not an accident that I chose to marry an educator."
D,I am so proud of the work my husband Tom does as Principal of Phillips Exeter Academy and am so grateful for the support he has given me.
D,"Tom, you will bring insight, humor, and skill to the role of First Gentleman."
D,Thank you.
D,I am also a very proud mother.
D,"My two children, Ben and Meg have inspired me, grounded me, and supported me."
D,I wouldn’t be here without you.
D,"And I can’t talk about my family without acknowledging how much we have been helped – and enriched – by the team of caregivers who have provided superb care and support to Ben, allowing him to receive a full education and participate in his community."
D,"You have become an integral part of our family and give proof to idea that when we care for each other, we all get stronger."
D,Thank you.
D,"I want the same for all of New Hampshire’s young people as I want for my own children: the opportunity to learn, to grow, and to lead."
D,"Recently, I had the privilege of visiting Girls, Inc. in Nashua, which helps teach important life skills to girls and young women."
D,Dozens of energetic girls – ranging from wriggling 5 and 6 years old to collected teenagers – had waited patiently for us to arrive.
D,They had researched the questions they wanted to ask and their knowledge was impressive.
D,But it wasn’t really the topics that were important.
D,They were being encouraged to imagine and realize that they could be leaders too.
D,That they could be anything they wanted to be.
D,"In order for the girls I met at Girls Inc. – and all of our young people – to realize their dreams, we must ensure that at each step along the way, their education is providing them with the skills, knowledge, and innovative thinking needed in a 21st century economy."
D,"We must work with teachers, local schools, higher education and the business community to ensure a robust and rigorous education for all of our students, including in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math."
D,New Hampshire’s public colleges and universities have set an ambitious goal of doubling the number of STEM students that graduate by 2025.
D,We should embrace that goal and make achieving it a state priority.
D,Businesses are ready and willing to hire people with these skills.
D,Our task is to make sure New Hampshire’s workforce is ready to fill these jobs.
D,We have other opportunities and challenges as well.
D,"To compete in the 21st century, our businesses must find new markets for their innovative goods and services."
D,Ninety-five percent of the world’s consumers live outside of the United States.
D,"I want New Hampshire to be a leader in exports, and in the next two years I’ll work to help our businesses sell their products around the globe."
D,"To encourage innovation, we should also encourage the creation of new technologies here in New Hampshire by doubling the research and development tax credit."
D,"We want entrepreneurs with innovative ideas to come to New Hampshire, and we want those who start businesses here to stay here and grow here."
D,That means continuing to build strategic partnerships between our colleges and universities and our inventors and entrepreneurs.
D,Take the example of Therma-HEXX in Portsmouth.
D,"Bob Barmore, Therma-HEXX’s founder and CEO, had the idea of using low-cost, energy efficient components to build simple heating and cooling devices for homes and commercial buildings."
D,Bob told me the idea came to him when he was sitting with his wife on a rooftop deck that was too cold in the winter and too warm in the summer.
D,"He thought, ""There has to be a way to fix this."""
D,"He did, and with support and guidance from the Green Launching Pad, a business incubator at UNH, Bob has developed his idea into a successful and growing business right here in New Hampshire."
D,"To support these businesses, we must recognize that there are some tasks that can only be accomplished in partnership with government."
D,"Chief among those are ensuring access to education for all, protecting public safety and building and maintaining the infrastructure that businesses and citizens need."
D,"We must recognize that businesses, from our established industries, such as manufacturing and tourism, to the industries of the future, cannot innovate and grow without the modern roads, bridges, broadband and reliable and clean power they require."
D,"To address our challenges and seize the opportunity of innovation, we must summon our best traditions of cooperation and problem solving."
D,"The people of our state collaborate and make things work all the time, and their elected leaders must be able to do the same."
D,"The people of New Hampshire have made it clear that they want to restore balance, that they want us to work together."
D,Let us promise ourselves today that we will meet our challenges by focusing on commonsense solutions born of collaboration.
D,"That we will together end the era of hasty, reactive government."
D,I understand the work of the House and the Senate.
D,I was honored to be one of you.
D,What you do matters and affects the lives of real people.
D,To the best of my abilities I will work with you and foster an open dialogue.
D,"In return, I urge members of both parties to share your ideas and concerns with me."
D,My door will be open and together we can find a way to solve problems and make New Hampshire a better place.
D,Among the most challenging tasks ahead is the need to foster innovative economic growth while continuing to balance the state budget.
D,"While we are seeing signs of recovery and growth, we still face fiscal uncertainty; we will need to be prudent as we develop our budget."
D,And I am mindful that innovation is not confined to the private sector.
D,"We need to continue to find ways to innovate in state government, so that we can honor our tradition of fiscal responsibility while serving the people of New Hampshire effectively and efficiently."
D,Granite Staters are frugal and the history of our state government reflects that.
D,"To those of you who believe deeply in an income tax, I ask you to put that aside."
D,I will veto an income or sales tax.
D,"And as we build our next budget, though we have much to address, we must acknowledge that we will not be able to do everything all at once."
D,"To those on the other side, I ask you to recognize that there are some things that government must do – not only to help our most vulnerable citizens but also to provide the platform for economic growth."
D,Needs do not go away simply because we don’t fund them.
D,And opportunities for innovation and growth can evaporate if we fail to make smart investments in a timely way.
D,But if we work together we can fund our priorities and balance the budget.
D,"As lawmakers, we must also recognize that our first and most important obligation is to protect the safety of New Hampshire families."
D,"I am so grateful to all those in our state who put their lives on the line to protect our communities, from the police officers, fire fighters, EMTs and other first responders, to corrections officers and security personnel, to state employees who maintain our health and safety, and so many more."
D,"And we are grateful and proud of our veterans and members of the armed forces and the New Hampshire National Guard, so many of whom have been deployed repeatedly overseas in the last several years to protect our state and our nation while we have been at war."
D,I know we all remain shaken by the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
D,We can be comforted in the knowledge that our New Hampshire educators are as bravely and professionally devoted to their students as the heroes in Newtown were.
D,"We can be grateful that our first responders protect us by responding to grave and unknown dangers with calm, skill and intensity."
D,"But while our faith in those who provide for the safety of our communities should be stronger than ever, we will all need to honor the victims of the Newtown tragedy by coming together to find ways to make our schools and our towns better and safer."
D,There is so much that I love about our state.
D,Most mornings I walk in the woods along the Exeter River.
D,"The sound of pine needles crackling under foot, the muted alarm of mallards as my dog and I walk by, the beauty and the stillness of an ice-covered stream, bring clarity and cheer me as I begin my day."
D,It reminds me that New Hampshire is a place of unmatched natural beauty.
D,"We see it in the mountains that tower over the North Country, in the lakes that freckle our state, and in the rocky shores and sandy beaches of the Seacoast."
D,We see it in every town and city.
D,"The awe-inspiring beauty of our natural resources is critical to our hunting, fishing and tourism industries."
D,It attracts businesses and entrepreneurs to New Hampshire.
D,And it is critical to the quality of our daily lives.
D,But what I love most about New Hampshire is the all-hands-on-deck ethos of our people.
D,"Whenever there is a challenge, our people are ready to help and pitch in."
D,We are a state that combines independence and community as nowhere else.
D,But that ethos requires that we fully include all people of talent and energy in the life of our State.
D,Inclusiveness is part of our history.
D,New Hampshire was at the forefront of the fight to save the union and end slavery.
D,"Over the decades we have welcomed waves of new citizens, from the Irish and French-Canadian immigrants of the 19th century to the immigrants from Nepal, Bhutan and all around the world who are reinvigorating our state today."
D,"We are a model for including both men and women in our political process, exemplified today when a woman Supreme Court Chief Justice swore in a woman Governor."
D,We led the effort to end discrimination against people who experience disabilities and we helped bring them out of institutions and into the community.
D,"Our recommitment now to that endeavor will strengthen our families, communities, and economy."
D,"And nearly four years ago, we led the way, without the force of a court order, toward marriage equality."
D,"Last year I was on a plane when the man next to me struck up a conversation and asked me about my work in public service, including Marriage Equality."
D,"It turns out he was a recruiter for one of the biggest employers in New Hampshire, and he said to me, ""Marriage Equality is one of the best recruitment tools I have."""
D,He said it wasn’t because he was necessarily recruiting gay or lesbian individuals.
D,It was because passing Marriage Equality in New Hampshire signaled to everyone the kind of welcoming state that we are.
D,"As has been true throughout our history, every time we bring more people in from the margins – into the heart and soul of our democracy – we get stronger."
D,We believe in freedom and the value of every person.
D,It is our duty and our destiny to extend the same freedoms we enjoy to all our people.
D,The work of moving this special state forward cannot be done by office holders alone.
D,"The doors of this State House are open to all who want to engage, learn, and contribute."
D,It will take the ideas and spirit and energy of everyone.
D,"More so than any other place, New Hampshire is a government ""by the people."""
D,Addressing our challenges will not be easy.
D,It will be hard.
D,But we are Granite Staters and Americans and we are supposed to do hard things.
D,The question is whether we will live up to the grand vision that our founders had.
D,"Remember, the notion that we could operate as a true citizen democracy while also becoming an economic force in the world was, at the time, a revolutionary one."
D,"To some degree, our ability to prove our founders right will depend on how we approach our task."
D,"Scripture refers to something called, ""gladness of heart,"" an appreciation of the opportunity and freedom to do difficult things."
D,"In this time and in this place, let’s choose to move our state forward with the optimism and pragmatism that is our hallmark."
D,"With ""gladness of heart,"" let’s choose to remember what a gift it is to be citizens of the Granite State."
D,Thank you.
D,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests, fellow Vermonters:
Thank you."
D,It is an honor to stand before you today.
D,"Thank you, Governor Douglas, for 38 years of exemplary public service to the Green Mountain state."
D,We are grateful for your hard work and sacrifice on our behalf and to Dorothy and your family for sharing so much of your life with us.
D,Thank you to Brian Dubie for your service as Lieutenant Governor for the past eight years.
D,"While Brian and I had a spirited campaign this fall, I am proud to call Brian my friend; we are united in our love for our state and the constituents we serve."
D,Members of Governor Shumlin's cabinet and other dignitaries watch from the balcony.
D,"Since my election in November, I have had the honor of joining Governor Douglas and our Congressional delegation in welcoming home our soldiers from Afghanistan after the biggest deployment of National Guard troops since World War II."
D,We are so proud of you and thrilled to have you home.
D,Our hearts go out to our Gold Star families who have made the ultimate sacrifice to our state and nation.
D,"Today, joining Adjutant General Michael Dubie in the gallery are veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq: Brigadier General Jonathan Farnham, Captain Cathy Cappetta, and Chief Master Sergeant Steven Zappi."
D,"Also joining them is Command Sergeant Major Michael Datillio, who is retiring after 44 years of service to his state and his country."
D,"Please join me in recognizing these brave women and men ‘ and all the Vermonters who have served in our armed services in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere abroad."
D,I am grateful to my loving family and friends for your faith and support; and to all who worked so hard to make this moment possible.
D,"Above all, thank you Vermonters for giving me this opportunity to serve you as Governor; I am both honored and humbled."
D,"That I stand before you today as Vermont's 81st Governor was improbable, and no one can attest to that better than my mom and dad, who are here today."
D,My mom reminded me again on election night that it often seemed more likely in my grade school years that I would struggle to find a job than to run for office.
D,"As a kid who learned differently, I remember well in second grade being called into the principal’s office with my parents to have them be told what I already knew, but hoped beyond hope that they would never find out: that with all the good efforts of my teachers they could not teach me how to read; that the prospects of my being a successful student and going onto college were unlikely, but they would do the best they could."
D,That was not a great day.
D,I had a single teacher who believed in me.
D,Her name was Claire Ogelsby; she later became Vermont's teacher of the year.
D,Her husband Mac and daughter Molly are here today.
D,Claire would be here too had she not lost her battle with cancer a year and a half ago.
D,"After her long day at school, Claire loaded me in her Willy's Jeep and took me to her log cabin deep in the woods on Windmill Hill Road in Westminster West."
D,In the warm weather we sat on her lawn; in the cold weather we huddled around the wood stove; and slowly and creatively she taught me how to read.
D,"What I remember best about Claire was no matter how difficult the challenge; no matter how innovative she had to be or how hard she had to work, she never gave up on me and therefore neither did I.
I share that part of my life today because we are living in difficult times and we need to be creative to overcome our challenges."
D,Let me be clear about the fiscal reality that our great state faces at this moment.
D,"After several years of making necessary but painful spending cuts, we are still confronted with a $150 million shortfall in the next fiscal year."
D,"Our economic challenges are real, and so is my firm commitment to address them responsibly and swiftly ‘ with hard, sometimes painful but sustainable choices."
D,There is no easy or popular path ahead.
D,"While I am bound and determined to put Vermont on a sustainable spending path this year, balancing the budget is not our biggest challenge."
D,"All across our state, too many Vermonters are living in fear: fear that they might lose their jobs, face another pay cut, fail to keep their home, send their children to college, afford health insurance or a secure retirement."
D,"That fear knows no political party; it has lost patience in finding solace in political slogans and false promises, it takes no more comfort from a tea party rally in Tallahassee than it does from a bickering government in Washington, DC."
D,Vermonters wonder: is anyone in government listening?
D,"Can we let go of the political speak, stop playing pretend, face the facts, and arrive at a common purpose?"
D,"From Bennington to Burlington, Guilford to Guildhall and Stamford to Swanton, our state is uniquely united in what we wish for."
D,Vermonters want jobs and a brighter economic future for themselves and their children.
D,The guiding principle for my administration’s work is simple: we will commit ourselves every day to making the lives of Vermonters more economically secure.
D,"With the same fortitude and creative determination that Claire showed in her zeal to teach me and other students who learned like me, one student at a time, I believe in Vermont’s opportunity to replace fear with a bright economic future, one job at a time."
D,A clear vision for job growth and a bold plan to deliver that vision is what Vermont needs right now.
D,"The last Putney boy to become Governor, almost three quarters of a century ago, was George D. Aiken, whose wife Lola joins us here today."
D,Governor Aiken also had a bold vision for Vermont's job growth that he shared with this Joint Assembly as he bid farewell as Governor.
D,"He said, ‘Vermont is one of a few states that can sell four feet of snow and twenty below at a profit.’
Aiken delivered those words at the dawn of the Vermont snow rush, as chainsaw toting men carved ski trails and second home sites into Green Mountains as rugged and majestic as Vermonters themselves."
D,From Killington to Jay; Stratton to Stowe; Mount Snow to Mad River Glen; Aiken articulated a plan that remains a potent economic force almost 75 years later.
D,"As we close out the first decade of the 21st century, Aiken's world of predictable winters, with twenty below and four feet of snow has been slowly but certainly melting away from us."
D,It's at Aiken's home at Vermont's southern border; at the soil he tilled; the maple trees he nurtured; the ponds he adored; that his horticulturalist’s eyes would gaze in stark amazement at the magnitude of change.
D,"The Elm and Butternut are all but gone, the buckthorn is choking out the young hardwood saplings, and many of the ponds that once bubbled with life are now empty waterways."
D,"While leaders across America, influenced by the extraordinary economic power of oil, coal and automobile companies, equivocate about climate change, we must not."
D,That our planet is warming at an alarming rate is undeniable.
D,But I raise this not to engage in an abstract discussion of climate science.
D,I raise it because I believe Vermont’s economic future will be determined by how we respond to this challenge.
D,"We will provide the brainpower, make the products, and seize the job opportunities a lower carbon economy requires."
D,Vermont’s diversified jobs future is bright.
D,"Manufacturing, deployment and production of renewable energy and efficiency, tourism, technology, and agriculture are all sectors of our economy with potential for unlimited growth."
D,"As we work to put Vermonters back to work, one job at a time, let us always be mindful that government does not create jobs; entrepreneurs do."
D,What government must do is to make the necessary infrastructure choices that are essential to job growth for this new era.
D,"This agenda consists of five goals: expanding broadband, containing health care costs, educating our work force, providing tax fairness and credit for emerging businesses, and supporting a renaissance in Vermont agriculture."
D,"It is big, it is ambitious, and it is achievable if we view it as our common purpose."
D,"Today I am launching Connect VT, an initiative to deliver by 2013 my promise of high-speed Internet access and cell service to every corner of our state."
D,"If not confronted, our connectivity deficit will relegate us to an economic backwater."
D,Vermont lags behind the developing world and ranks 46th among the fifty states in connectivity.
D,"Governor Aiken, when facing an equally daunting challenge of bringing electricity to every last mile of this rural state, in the 1930's, launched a strategy he called ‘Initiative and Cooperation.’
Listen for a moment to the words he wrote in August 1939, about that effort: ‘A few weeks ago I pulled the switch that started the current flowing through a cooperative electric line that is bringing the blessings of light and power to hundreds of farms and homes in another Vermont community-homes which, in the past, had been almost completely isolated from urban civilization.’
Seventy-two years after Aiken wrote those words about the need to bring Vermont out of its isolation, we must display the same foresight to confront an equally daunting isolation."
D,"The spirit that led Aiken to bring Vermont out of the darkness is the same innovative cooperation that is called upon today from our private sector telecommunications providers, the Vermont utilities, regulators and our citizens, if we are to deliver the new electric current of the modern world to Vermont."
D,"We have $410 million in private, federal, and bonded capital to be strategically deployed."
D,"These resources present Vermonters with a once in a life-time opportunity to ‘initiate and cooperate’ by completing the build out of the Smart Grid, broadband and mobile phone service in a collaborative marriage of the telecommunications and electrical utility sectors to create one shared broadband infrastructure for Vermont."
D,We will not and cannot compete and prosper in the global economy until and unless we deliver on this promise.
D,"We all know success won't be easy, but Vermonters elected me on my pledge to get tough things done, and we will."
D,"Indeed, we are too small to fail."
D,The rising cost of healthcare for Vermont's middle class and small businesses provides an equally daunting threat to economic prosperity.
D,Just ten years ago our little state was spending $2.5 billion a year to stay healthy.
D,Today we spend over $5 billion.
D,That increase represents an enormous hidden tax on families and small businesses across our state.
D,"If left untethered, the rising cost of health insurance will cripple us."
D,"That's why we must create a single-payer healthcare system that provides universal, affordable health insurance for all Vermonters that brings these skyrocketing costs under control."
D,Let Vermont be the first state in the nation to treat healthcare as a right and not a privilege; removing the burden of coverage from our business community and using technology and outcomes-based medicine to contain costs.
D,"By doing so, we will save money and improve the quality of our care."
D,Some will say it can't be done.
D,"The special interests; insurance companies, pharmaceutical industry, medical equipment makers; the same lobbyists that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure that real reform withered in Washington can be expected to exercise their will to protect their enormous profits."
D,Others will say reform will destroy our existing healthcare system.
D,"But logic suggests ‘ and our experience shows - that our current system is unsustainable; that underfunded reimbursements starve our doctors and hospitals; that duplication, waste, inefficiencies and rising costs will drive more rural providers into bankruptcy and destroy our quality of care, which is the very best in the land."
D,"I ask the defenders of the current system to explain how small businesses, municipalities and taxpayers can sustain double digit premium increases year after year."
D,Shortly we will receive plans from Dr. William Hsiao to help us design a health care system that Vermonters can afford.
D,"I've assembled a healthcare team that will invite providers, consumers, businesses, municipalities, insurers, and our congressional delegation to the table to help Vermont build a sensible healthcare system."
D,I call upon single payer supporters to resist the temptation to oversimplify the challenge.
D,"I call upon skeptics to challenge us, but to join us at the table."
D,"I call upon Vermonters to join together with the common purpose of our state once again leading where others dare not go; universal, affordable, quality healthcare that follows the individual and is not tied to employment."
D,"In a democratic society, educating our citizens is our single greatest obligation."
D,"I hereby call for an end to the war of words launched from Montpelier that pits property tax payers against our children, teachers, principals, and school board members, and invite instead a respectful conversation on how to create the best education system for our future; how to produce the best workforce for the jobs we’ve just discussed."
D,We take pride in Vermont's quality education system that is the envy of the rest of the country.
D,Let’s build upon our success by doing even better.
D,"The objective is simple: every Vermonter must have the same opportunity for success that Claire Ogelsby made possible for me; economically, intellectually and socially."
D,Part of achieving that success is ensuring that our children don’t grow up in poverty.
D,Almost one in three Vermont children live in low-income households.
D,"Without proper nutrition, quality early education, or a stable home, these children too often enter kindergarten far behind their peers, and the spiral begins."
D,"They are more likely to drop out of school, abuse substances, and become statistics later in life."
D,"We can make a difference in their lives, and we will."
D,We can also do better at ensuring the success of all of our students in school.
D,"While we are rightfully proud of our outstanding education system, we are not delivering what is required for every student."
D,Time spent in class does not measure acquisition of skills.
D,"For those who quickly demonstrate clear levels of achievement, let's accelerate their path to enriched programs in that area of study."
D,"For students who do not learn in traditional ways, let’s support creative approaches that may be outside the four walls of our classrooms."
D,From early education to higher education; from dual enrollment to technical school; we have the most innovative offerings in the country.
D,Our challenge is to break down the silos into a seamless system that allows each individual learner to integrate the array of programs that inspire lifelong learning.
D,"Of course, education extends beyond our schools and to our workforce."
D,Herein lies a great challenge.
D,"At a time when Vermonters are facing unemployment and underemployment, many of our jobs creators can't find qualified employees, and it’s government’s responsibility to help fix this problem."
D,Let me be specific: right here in the chamber today we have representatives of businesses who are looking for qualified employees.
D,IBM in Essex is looking; GE in Rutland is looking; Vermont Circuits in Brattleboro is looking; Sonnax in Rockingham is looking.
D,Our job is to have a pool of applicants trained and ready to work.
D,It should be the policy of the state of Vermont that learning never ends.
D,Working together in a partnership with our educational community we will close the gap between those Vermonters who want work and our job creators who have work to do.
D,"At no time in my memory has the future of agriculture in our state had more potential to grow and make money, despite the extraordinarily difficult times facing our dairy farmers."
D,"Vermont still produce over 60 percent of the milk in New England, and our dairy community is as unified and focused as I have ever seen it."
D,Working together with our Congressional delegation ‘ the best in the country ‘ we will continue the fight for fair prices for our dairy farmers.
D,The renaissance in Vermont agriculture is rooted in the growing concern by consumers across America about where and how their food is produced.
D,"Consumers are increasingly demanding locally grown, chemical-free, high quality food."
D,"We must take Vermont’s strengths ‘ buy local, farmers markets, farm to plate, Vermont Fresh Network restaurants ‘ and expand our view of local to everything within 200 miles of Vermont, which includes Manhattan, Boston, and Montreal."
D,"Investing in processing and bottling facilities, combined with a dynamic marketing effort for Vermont quality foods, will bring our farmers the value-added price that they deserve for a hard day’s work, and they will prosper."
D,"Finally, my jobs agenda will expand the ability of emerging enterprises and businesses to access capital and credit when they need it the most."
D,"If our Green Mountain State can be recognized by young entrepreneurs as the innovative leader in financing and venture capital for micro-businesses when banks say ‘no,’ small businesses will thrive."
D,Let me give you an exciting example of what I mean by innovation in financing and venture capital.
D,"The EB-5 program, championed in Congress by Senator Leahy, is an established means of generating capital that is creating jobs."
D,"Thousands of them, right here in Vermont."
D,We must take this program to levels not imagined by its creators.
D,"EB-5 gives us a vehicle not only to raise essential capital, but also to spread Vermont’s stellar reputation from one end of the globe to another."
D,"We have a pioneer in this effort, Bill Stenger, of Jay Peak, deep in the Northeast Kingdom, who joins us today."
D,Bill has plumbed this federal program to its fullest potential.
D,Through this initiative he has created over a thousand new jobs in the highest unemployment area of the state that would not otherwise exist.
D,Let me say one last word on my economic priorities.
D,Our choices about taxes directly impact job growth.
D,Vermont's tax challenge is not that our burden is not high enough; it is that our tax burden is too high.
D,We must develop a tax policy that grows our customer base and grows wealth.
D,The upcoming report from our tax commission will help us in this task.
D,"Our patchwork of broad based taxes that have accumulated over the years, combined with overburdened property taxes, require our attention."
D,"But let me be clear: as we tackle the difficult challenge of balancing our budget, we must not and cannot succumb to the idea that Vermonters have the capacity to pay higher taxes right now."
D,"In order to grow jobs and be more competitive with neighboring states, we must resist the temptation to raise broad-based taxes."
D,"I am the first to acknowledge that this action plan is ambitious, and I have not mentioned many of my administration’s other priorities: reducing recidivism for non-violent offenders; rebuilding our roads and bridges; reforming our campaign finance laws; and making government more transparent."
D,You will be hearing more about these and other initiatives in the near future.
D,"Our obstacles are many, and our challenges are daunting."
D,The change we are proposing this afternoon is transformative and systemic.
D,It will not happen quickly or easily.
D,"Yet as I stand here today to begin a new era of government in Vermont, I remember Claire Oglesby and the many Vermonters who embody her belief that we can overcome adversity with courage and creativity."
D,Vermonters are a rugged people with an abundance of spirit and toughness.
D,Each day is another day in which we can excel.
D,We must intensify our individual efforts to nurture the health and well being of our state and its people.
D,Together we can be bold.
D,Together we must be bold.
D,Let’s begin now.
D,Thank you
