Party,Sentence
R,"Honorable Governor Castro, Governor Mofford, Governor Symington, Governor Hull."
R,"Mr. Speaker and Mr. President, Madame Chief Justice and associate justices, Incoming Secretary Bennett, General Goddard, Superintendent Horne, Treasurer Martin, Mine Inspector Hart, Commissioner Pierce, Commissioner Stump, and Commissioner Kennedy, members of the Legislature, and honored guests ."
R,.
R,.
R,I’m grateful for your presence and your lasting support over so many years.
R,"Among your faces I see not only the colleagues of countless political seasons, but the friendships of a lifetime."
R,Let me also thank Pastor Spicer for your uplifting words and for being a constant source of inspiration for me and my family.
R,"And of course, let me thank my wonderful supportive family... oDr."
R,"John Brewer – a true pillar of strength – he continues to stand side-by-side with me as we walk 
2down life’s path together."
R,"My children, John (may god bless his soul), Ron, and Michael – your love and constant support help sustain me through everything we confront in life."
R,"oAnd to my brother...and rest of my family,...it means a great deal to me that you traveled here for this event, thank you for being here as well."
R,"I also must extend a sincere thanks to Secretary Napolitano  --  see, we’ve traded titles  --  for her service to the state; and offer prayers and good will in her vitally important position with our new president."
R,One reason life is such a delightful adventure is that we never know exactly what it will bring.
R,No one ever knew it would bring me here.
R,But one thing is certain: there’s no place I would rather be.
R,Of course this turn of events has not been cause for universal celebration.
R,In some quarters this inauguration feels a good deal more like an interruption.
R,"And in a few ways  --  good ways, we can hope  --   it will be."
R,"But I pledge today to be a governor for all of Arizona, and to lead our state to better times."
R,"Together, we will do what we have to do, without pettiness or melodrama or misplaced regard to party, and we will succeed."
R,At a government’s new hour we normally find ourselves uplifted by possibility.
R,"But today, we find ourselves weighed down with obligation -- overdue obligation."
R,"We are gathered amid uncertain times, with a difficult work before us."
R,"In some ways this feels like you’ve just shown up for a party  --   but the guests have all gone, only the caterer is left and she immediately hands you the bill."
R,But let’s be clear about one thing.
R,Authentic public service --   rendered so faithfully by so many here today -- does not return barren.
R,"Even in hard times, we must do good work, in honest trust with those we serve, and the people will thank us for it."
R,"3For decades, the abundance generated by free, hard-working Americans has allowed government to remain in the habit of growing, and in recent years to grow even more rapidly."
R,"But today, neither prudence nor our Constitution will allow this to continue in our state."
R,We have all been seated to preside over that rarest of political happenings: our government is going to get smaller.
R,"We know this, and so do the people we serve."
R,Here is the situation.
R,"Essentially, for this and the next fiscal year, the people who do the work, provide the tax dollars and count on our performance were told we would have about $21 billion dollars to spend on their government."
R,"In reality, we aren’t going to have that at all."
R,We are going to be a little short -- somewhere on the order of $4 billion short.
R,"That’s a lot of money, but there will be no time for gloom or further denial."
R,We know the necessary reductions in state spending will not occur without impact to people’s lives and livelihoods.
R,"Our task is to minimize that impact as much as we can, even as we keep our state moving toward a brighter future."
R,"I’m a gardener at heart, and over the years I’ve noticed a few things that gardening and governing share in common."
R,"To grow beautiful things, you must have good seeds and provide water and sunshine; and then you have to control the weeds, spray the pests and run off the rabbits."
R,"Having served there, doesn’t that sound a bit like the legislature to you?"
R,But every gardener also knows that some pruning from time to time leads to greater fruit.
R,Building a budget is a zero-sum game.
R,"We must make an honest accounting of the expected revenues, set priorities for expenditures and retain a prudent ending balance and cash reserve."
R,4But building an economy that supports that spending is absolutely not a zero-sum game.
R,"Even while we focus on the process of two budgets, we must act with bold determination to put Arizona’s economy back on its feet, increase opportunity, and secure the futures of our people."
R,"My fellow Arizonans, it is important to remember that we cannot budget our way to prosperity, and still less, we will not attain prosperity by taxing our way there either."
R,"Our first calling at this capitol is to generate capital --  to call forth the creativity, determination and entrepreneurial spirit that made these United States the most prosperous great power in the history of the world."
R,"I’m therefore pleased to report that the legislative leadership, my transition team and I are not sitting idle while the new government in Washington plans another trillion dollars in deficit spending."
R,"No, we are planning a massive stimulus package of our own, to make Arizona the most economically vibrant place in the world."
R,"And just like the clever folks in Washington, we have a catchy name for it: It’s called “freedom.”Yes, we must keep our tax and regulatory burdens low, something I have stood for throughout my 26 years in public life."
R,We must make sure that beleaguered businesses in California and other such overtaxed places hear the music of our commerce and our culture and see brighter prospects in the cities and towns across Arizona.
R,But that is not nearly enough.
R,"In every way we can, we must make our people free."
R,"Free to work and earn a living, to build a business, to build a life."
R,"Free to find and speak the truth about their government, and those who would lead it."
R,Free from crime and violence and lawlessness of all kinds.
R,"Free to move from place to place, across town or across the world, without gridlock and endless frustration."
R,"Free to choose 
5the schools their children will attend, and to find a safe and sound learning environment in every public institution."
R,"Free to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and to contemplate the hand of God in the forms and colors of our breathtakingly beautiful state, and upon the hearts of its diverse people."
R,"Free to pursue an authentic higher education in our great research universities and our community colleges, at a cost that will not leave them under a crushing debt."
R,"These freedoms, no less than others enumerated in our nation’s founding documents, are what made this land great across nearly two-and-a-half centuries."
R,"Freedom is not a mere word, but the purpose and calling of mankind."
R,It ennobles us.
R,"It has been the inspiration of a nation, the animation of a great and distinguished people called Americans, and the hope of cherished youth who have fought and died in distant places, so that we might keep it and know its blessings."
R,"And so surely we who labor at this capitol can do our part to protect freedom, too."
R,Like so many Americans I am a sports fan.
R,"I long for the thrill of the game, and I love the courage and competitive intelligence of great athletes."
R,"What a wonderful example our very own Super Bowl bound Arizona Cardinals have been, in that regard."
R,"One thing many great athletes can tell you is this: When you are struggling, return to the fundamentals."
R,"Get the fundamentals right, and the strong performance follows."
R,"In America our fundamental value, our lodestar and our true north,... is freedom."
R,"Our greatest struggles, and gravest sins, have come when we have valued freedom too little, or coldly denied its promise to others."
R,"Consider the symmetry in the present crisis  --  a struggling nation, with a haunting chapter in 
6its past, has just proudly inaugurated its first African-American President."
R,"To better times, we will find no surer path than freedom."
R,My path to this platform today has not been paved with privilege.
R,"When I was a little girl, my widowed mother supported my brother and I with a small dress shop."
R,"From the time I was 10 years old, I helped my mother, always learning along the way."
R,"Later in life I worked in a number of jobs, none of which were necessarily glamorous."
R,"I have come to know want, and worry, and the anxiety that touches so many people around our state today."
R,"But I know with all certainty that we will make our stand, and soon we will be living out our finest days."
R,"We will get there by the light of Lady Margaret Thatcher, who helped Ronald Reagan to save freedom in the 20th Century."
R,"“Our policy,” she said, “is not built on envy or hatred, but on liberty for the individual man or woman."
R,"It is not our policy to suppress success; our policy is to encourage it, and encourage energy and initiative.” It’s a widely and sometimes bitterly held view that Arizona has been living high off it’s growth for the past 25 years, and there is some truth in that."
R,"But it’s also true that going forward, we will still be living off our growth  --  but less the growth of our suburbs, and more the growth of our people."
R,"In 20th Century Arizona, land was king, as we planted and mined and built our way through adolescence as a state."
R,Those things will continue to be critical pillars of our economy.
R,"But in 21stCentury Arizona talent will be king  --  or queen, if you’d rather  --  and we will both cultivate and attract it through freedom."
R,This is the ancient cause and the common cry that can unite us for our present works.
R,"Together we will succeed in this cause, and I look forward to serving you and our great state."
R,"Thank you, and may God continue to bless each of you and every Arizonan across our land."
R,"

Good afternoon."
R,"A few moments ago I raised my right hand, humbled in spirit and with hopefulness in my heart, to take the oath of office as Governor of the State of Connecticut."
R,"It is not a position I sought through the normal course of electoral politics, but little has seemed normal over the past several months."
R,"Few could have accurately predicted the incredible, seemingly unrelenting, series of events that have led to today's actions."
R,It has been a time of profound disappointment and disillusionment.
R,"It has been a moment in history that we never thought we would see, and fervently hope that we never see again."
R,"Yet while the people's trust in government has been weakened, I know that Connecticut is resilient."
R,"Ours is a strength that is centuries old, but ever new."
R,"The wellspring of our state's strength is untainted by corruption, and untouched by controversy."
R,It's the optimism of Connecticut families -- always ready to look forward to tomorrow.
R,"A new administration is taking shape, and though awed and inspired by the incredible responsibilities that await me, I assume the governorship of our .great state with respect, honor, and modesty."
R,The time to heal has begun.
R,"Yes, our trust has been broken."
R,Our faith in government has been shaken.
R,Our belief in the inherent virtue of public service has been called into question.
R,We have been tested.
R,We have been tried.
R,"But there can be no doubt, with this historic transfer of power today, that the very principles upon which our constitution, our laws, and our system of government are built are far stronger and far greater than the frailties and failures of anyone individual or group of people."
R,Today we chart a new course.
R,"Today, we begin to restore faith, integrity, and honor to our government."
R,It is our solemn obligation.
R,It will be our lasting legacy.
R,I deeply believe that public service is a noble and necessary cause.
R,"For generations, indeed for more than two centuries, well intentioned, virtuous men and women have served our state well."
R,"We cannot allow the actions of a relative few to tarnish all who serve, or more significantly, to discourage future generations from answering their call to service."
R,We must and we will recommit ourselves to ending the culture of corruption that has plagued our state for far too long.
R,"To that end, my first order of business as the 87th Governor of Connecticut is to issue Executive Order Number One, which imposes strict ethics restraints on those who serve in state government."
R,"It also creates a new public integrity officer in my cabinet - a person who will report directly to me and who will work with enforcement agencies on matters involving corruption, unethical practices, or alleged abuses of public authority."
R,She will also aggressively educate and train state employees on both the spirit and letter of the laws regarding ethics.
R,"Let the message be clear: From this day forward, if you are entrusted with public office, you will uphold the highest standards of public integrity and ethical principles."
R,"Ours is a rich and proud history, and we will return pride to our state."
R,"Connecticut will again be home to innovation, idealism, and integrity in government service."
R,"To be sure, this is a time unlike any other in our state's history, and in many ways we have a most unique occasion to govern."
R,We should view our opportunity to lead as a gift --- a gift holding unlimited potential and promise for addressing long unmet needs and long-standing policy problems.
R,"Let us not squander our opportunity, for there is too much work to do and too many pressing priorities ahead."
R,My administration will work steadfastly to create jobs and grow our economy.
R,"Over the next few weeks and months, we will be proposing new initiatives on the economy, education, and campaign finance reform."
R,We will also seek a spirit of cooperation and public service transcending partisanship.
R,We will work together to find common ground in philosophy and workable solutions to complex issues.
R,"Before turning the page and moving forward, let me take a moment to acknowledge that these have been very difficult and trying times for everyone - including Governor Rowland and his family."
R,"My thoughts and prayers are with them, and I ask you to remember them as well."
R,"My pledge, as your new governor, is a simple one: I will work tirelessly, with honor, dignity, and civility in the days and weeks to come."
R,"I ask for your support, your understanding, and your prayers."
R,But now we start anew.
R,And so the journey begins.
R,"Thank you, and God Bless the Great State of Connecticut."
R,"Good afternoon/morning, Illinois."
R,"Great day, Illinois!"
R,"Thank you so much!--I want to begin by thanking my wife, Diana."
R,"She is my partner and my best friend –and she is going to be a tremendous First Lady!--And thank you to our six kids who have endured a lot over the past two years and will have to put up with even more over the next four.--I want to acknowledge Governor Quinn for his years of service to the state and the people of Illinois.--I’d like to recognize and thank our distinguished guests:-Madam Chief Justice and distinguished members of the Court-President Cullerton-Speaker Madigan-Leader Radogno-Leader Durkin-Attorney General Madigan-Secretary of State White-Comptroller-designate Munger-Treasurer-elect Frerichs-Members of the General Assembly-Members of the Congressional delegation-Governor Edgar-Mayor Houston-Mayor Emanuel-Archbishop Cupich-Major General Krumrei and all the members of our National Guard.--Thank you, Evelyn, you’re the best partner I could possibly have to transform our state government –you’ll be a terrific Lieutenant Governor.----And I liked to express my very deepest gratitude to our veterans and our service men and women here today and around the world."
R,God bless you.
R,Thank you for your service to our country.
R,"As governor, I will do everything in my power to support you.--
I also want to say a very special thank you to our police officers, our corrections officers, our firefighters and all those who risk their lives to protect all the families of Illinois."
R,Thank you.
R,"I look forward to being an ally and advocate for you.----It is an honor to stand before you, before ALL the people of Illinois, today.I am humbled."
R,I am honored.
R,I am privileged.
R,"I am excited.I LOVE Illinois, and I want OURS to be a GREAT state, a great HOME for EVERY family here."
R,"I am ready to go to work for you.----As I’ve traveled our state over the last few years, I’ve met with tens of thousands of people; teachers and farmers, factory workers and coal miners, college students and retirees -the people who are the heart and soul of Illinois.In that process, I’ve met thousands of small business owners."
R,"In our discussions, I’ve been stunned by how many of them are frustrated and in trying to build their businesses here and are thinking of leaving.--I visited one company called Keats Manufacturing in Wheeling.Back in 1958, Bert and Glenn Keats started a metal stamping company in a storefront on Cicero Avenue in Chicago."
R,"Their father had never made it past high school, but both of them made it through college and were eager to start out on their own.They had one employee and a couple machines."
R,"They worked long hours, a second job and sacrificed much, but they made it and their company took off.Today, Keats Manufacturing employs 110 Illinois workers and has nearly 75 machines running 24 hours a day, 5 days per week.The story of Bert and Glenn Keats was not an uncommon path in our state."
R,"And it wasn’t just Chicago, and it wasn’t just manufacturing."
R,"It was Peoria, it was Rockford, it was Decatur."
R,"It was agriculture, it was transportation, it was technology.Illinois was a place where people like Bert and Glenn Keats from all over the country, indeed, from all over the world, wanted to come, because Illinois was a land of opportunity, almost without parallel in America.--Today’s Illinois is very different.--The grandsons of Bert and Glenn Keats –tell me they couldn’t have started their company in Illinois today."
R,"When their grandfathers started the company, all its customers were Illinois companies; they went door-to-door to find them."
R,"But today, none of their customers are Illinois companies –they have all left."
R,"And the grandsons told me that they, themselves, are feeling the pressure of high taxes 
and high regulation.--Today Illinois is not able to compete effectively with our neighboring states, our citizens are suffering because of it, and in many cases, they are up and leaving.Last year, we lost more people than any other state in America, and over the last ten years, we have ranked right near the bottom of all fifty states for out-migration."
R,"People are leaving to find jobs, or because they run companies, and they are taking their jobs with them.Our local businesses look in every direction and see states that are more appealing.Lifelong Illinoisans look at their future and think they canachieve more outside Illinois.You probably know a neighbor, a co-worker, or maybe even a son or daughter who has said, “I can do better somewhere else.”It breaks your heart, but you know it’s hard to argue with them.--We need a booming economy that is pro-growth, pro-business, pro-job creation or we won’t have the money to solve any of our other problems.Our state must become competitive again.In the weeks ahead, I’ll be asking the legislature to work with me to pass a comprehensive jobs and economic package that will get Illinois working again."
R,Let’s get our sons and daughters to return home!--One of the main reasons companies have been leaving Illinois is that they don’t have confidence in the financial condition of our state.
R,"We are in the midst of a government financial crisis that has been building for decades.Its roots lie in bad decisions, bad practices, and bad management by state government.It is not a partisan creation.It is a truly bipartisan one.Our government has spent more thanwe could afford; borrowed money and called it revenue."
R,"Rather than responsibly budgeting the money we had, we implemented programs we couldn’t afford."
R,"In the face of a declining economy, we raised taxes."
R,"This hurt our economy even more, put more stress onour social safety net, and pushed more Illinoisans out of our state, leaving fewer taxpayers to support the government."
R,"As a result, today Illinois is not as competitive as we need to be and cannot be as compassionate as we want to be.--Some in government will be tempted to once again take the easy road and leave the real problems for another day and the next generation.But, we can not do that because to do so, to conduct business as usual, would be morally corrupt.Instead, we have an opportunity to accomplish something historic: to fix years of busted budgets and broken government; to forge a path toward long-term prosperity and a brighter future; to make Illinois the kind of state others aspire to become, a national leader in job growth and education quality.--
To achieve that will require sacrifice.Sacrifice by all of us –politicians and interests groups, business and labor, those who pay for government and those who depend on government’s services.Each person here today and all those throughout the state will be called upon to share in the sacrifice so that one day we can again share in Illinois’s prosperity.We all must shake up our old ways of thinking.I promise to you this administration will make our decisions based on the next generation; not the next election.--I pledge to work on a bipartisan basis to drive results and get things done.--We must be united by our willingness to sacrifice and do what is right even if it is difficult.We must accept the challenge and the sacrifice, knowing that it will lead us to something greater.We must forget the days of feeling good about just making it through another year –by patching over major problems with stitches that are bound to break.Those stitches are now busting wide open and we must begin by taking immediate, decisive action.That’s why today, my first action as governor will be to direct every state agency to freeze non-essential spending.I’ll ask them to review and report on every contract that’s been signed since November 1.And I will follow through on my pledge to reduce my own salary to $1 and decline all benefits.----Our state’s crisis is not only financial."
R,"We have a MORAL crisis, an ETHICAL crisis as well."
R,"We have a state government that too few have faith in; that lack of faith is JUSTIFIED, and undermines people’s willingness to sacrifice and help the government in its mission.Illinoisans see insider deals and cronyism rewarded.They see lobbyists writing bills for special interests and taxpayers being left with the tab.They see government union bosses negotiating sweetheart deals across the table from governors they’ve spent tens of millions to help elect.It’s a corrupt bargain and the people of Illinois are left to wonder where they fit in.Who’s looking out for them and their families?Taxpayers’ money belongs to them; not the government."
R,"We have a moral obligation to minimize how much we take and to ensure what we do take is spent efficiently and effectively--Every dollar we spend unnecessarily inside government is a dollar we can’t put into classrooms or social service providers, or leave in the pockets of entrepreneurs and homeowners.--To the people of Illinois, and the people outside our state who have been reluctant to invest in Illinois because of the insider deals and cronyism, I say this:
--I’m nobody that nobody sent.--And I’ve come to work for you.--I will send a clear signal to everyone in our state, and to those watching from outside our borders, that business as usual is over."
R,"It stops now.--Tomorrow, I will sign an executive order that will improve ethics and accountability in the executive branch of state government."
R,These actions and others to follow will focus on regaining our state’s good name and reputation.
R,"We must prove every day that we have learned our lessons and are changing our ways.----In everything we do, we must ask ourselves, what does this mean for the next generation?For in order to thrive, we must prepare the next generation for success.From cradle to career, the people of Illinois deserve world-class educational opportunities.From early childhood and K through 12 schools, to vocational and technical training, to community colleges and higher ed, we need to invest adequately in every neighborhood."
R,"Next to being a mother or a father, teaching is the most important job in the world, and we must support our many good teachers."
R,"That means putting more directly into the classrooms, reforming the education bureaucracy, rolling back costly mandates and giving more students access to great schools.A high-quality education is essential for higher lifetime earnings, a competitive, world-class workforce and strong economic growth.It is the key to bringing back the American dream forevery family in Illinois; for making the American dream a REALITY for everyone here; a truly better life for the next generation.----If we work together, Illinois can be great again.We have everything needed to thrive –a great location, the economic and cultural center of the Midwest, fertile farms, infrastructure, and most importantly, wonderful, hard-working people –we just need the policy and leadership to make us the best we can possibly be.--In just three short years our great state will be celebrating its 200th Birthday.--Yes, 2018 will be our Bicentennial."
R,"What a perfect time these next few years will be to return our beloved Illinois to its rightful place as a leader among the states of America.A state that, as we prepare for our bicentennial, is ready to seize the future."
R,"A state where not only manufacturing companies like the Keats’ want to be, but where the next big things happen.A state where entrepreneurs want to be.A state where technology companies want to start.Where the next generation of manufacturing occurs.Where family farms that have made us a breadbasket for the world can pass from one generation to the next.Where young couples want to start their families.And their children are inspired in their schools.--Illinois is a state that truly embodies all that is great about America.Since the days of Lincoln, we have stood as a beacon of freedom and justice.Now let us embrace all that is wonderful about Illinois, the reasons we love it: our culture of hard work and responsibility, grounded, solid values, diversity, civic commitment and generosity –and harness it so that our next century is one of prosperity.We can do that if we work together, just as a family does when it faces tough times.Illinois is our home –and rightnow our home is hurting.But home and family are worth sacrificing for...worth fighting for.Together, let’s do the hard work to rebuild our home.I’m ready to get to work for you.I’m ready to fight for you.God bless you.God bless Illinois.And God blessAmerica."
R,Thank you.
R,Thank you.
R,I'm going to wipe my face here.
R,Thank you.
R,Thank you for being here.
R,This is humbling to say the very least.
R,You all came here to witness the changing of an administration.
R,This is what we do at times like this.
R,"And yet you're also here, and so many of you were the catalyst behind the fact, that you're here to witness a fresh start for Kentucky as well."
R,I want to start by saying thank you.
R,There so many people that we could thank.
R,I want to thank the men and women that are responsible for the scaffolding that we sit on; who have worked tirelessly to set this up.
R,For the men and women who have hung the bunting on this building.
R,The men and woman who have created these beautiful renditions of our state motto.
R,The men and women who have painted the things on which we stand.
R,The men and women who erected these tents and these screens and these towers of microphones and of speakers.
R,"The men and women who are represented out here who have finally, perhaps for a moment, gotten a break."
R,"And yet, even now, there are those that are providing security."
R,The men and women who have cut the grass.
R,"The men and women who when we are gone and the party is over, will come in and break all these things down."
R,Thank you.
R,Thank you to each and every one of you.
R,Thank you.
R,I want to thank the men and women who have been so intricately involved in this transition team.
R,To Mac Brown for spearheading that effort.
R,For all the hundreds who have been involved.
R,It is a herculean effort.
R,And yet so many have stepped up and do so with incredible skill and passion and commitment.
R,And we are all the beneficiaries for that.
R,I want to thank those that were on the inaugural committee.
R,I want to thank Kelly Knight and Joe Craft and all of the many others who have poured themselves into everything we see around us.
R,Extraordinary.
R,"Let's give a round of applause to those who made this event so, so special."
R,"I especially want to thank whoever was in charge for 60 degrees on December 8th and those of you in the front and those on this stage don't appreciate it, but those of you sitting back in the sun, you know it's 60 degrees over there."
R,"So I tell you, we are blessed indeed."
R,"I want to thank my wife, Glenna Bevin."
R,She is an amazing woman.
R,She will be an incredible First Lady.
R,She truly brought tears to my eyes.
R,"I remember the first time I saw her as well and I was a 24-year-old man, and I was somewhat taken by what I saw."
R,And she is still the most beautiful woman I know.
R,She has an amazing heart.
R,She's intelligent; she's articulate; she is so gifted beyond her own belief in herself.
R,She's an extraordinary mother.
R,She is someone who's an example to me time and time again.
R,I am so grateful to you and I look forward to serving this commonwealth with you.
R,I really do.
R,I also want to thank other family members of mine that are here.
R,I won't call them out by name or we would extend this beyond what any of you would have patience for.
R,My parents are here.
R,My children are here.
R,My brothers and sisters are here.
R,My nieces and nephews are here.
R,I do however want to single out one individual and I'm not sure where she's sitting at the moment.
R,"But in 1914 this building over here to my right and your left was built, the Governor's Mansion."
R,A beautiful building.
R,It has stood the stand of time since 1914.
R,"And in that very same year, my grandmother, who's here somewhere, was born."
R,My grandmother is 101 years old.
R,"And, she too, has stood the stands of time."
R,The tests of time.
R,And it is a privilege to have her and my entire family here today.
R,I want to thank Jenean Hampton.
R,What an extraordinary woman she is.
R,You got a glimpse of that.
R,You heard her heart.
R,She is somebody who is exceptional.
R,She's extraordinary.
R,She's a historical ground breaker.
R,She will represent this state with incredible passion; with incredible commitment.
R,Her intellect; her love of liberty; her love of America; her love of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and for all that makes us great and good this is what I look forward to.
R,She is a dear friend and someone who I tip my hat to and look forward to serving with.
R,Thank you Jenean.
R,I want to thank Gov.
R,Beshear and all those who are in this outgoing administration.
R,I want to thank you for the service that has been rendered to this state.
R,"It's so easy for us to take for granted in America how unusual it is, how extraordinary it is, that we can have a peaceful transfer of power."
R,"Not once, not twice not occasionally but time and time and time again."
R,Let us not forget how extraordinary that is.
R,How blessed we are to live in a nation where that is possible.
R,"And my hat's off to those who have served before us in this administration, I thank you, sir."
R,It is possible because of the very men and women who have been acknowledged today.
R,"Who were acknowledged in our parade; who've been acknowledged from this stage, but one more time I do want to say thank you to the men and women who have served this nation in uniform."
R,Thank you to the men and women one and a half million of whom have given their lives in combat.
R,"Who have died in uniform so that we might freely assemble, so that we might gather here, so that we might speak freely, that we might worship freely, that we might have freedom of the press so that we might have the very things that so very few in the history of the world have ever had even a glimpse of."
R,"Let us not take these things for granted because, as was sung and as has been stated as we know when we take the time to think about it, freedom is not free; it has been purchased at a great price."
R,And we thank those of you who have paid that price and to your families as well.
R,"I have had occasion over the course of the last two years to drive 95,000 miles around the Commonwealth of Kentucky."
R,It's a lot of miles in one state.
R,"And I've had occasion during driving 95,000 miles around Kentucky to see the obvious places -- the Louisvilles, the Lexingtons, the Frankforts, the Covingtons, the Paducahs, the Owensboros, the Pikevilles, the Ashlands, the fill in the blanks."
R,"I know if I don't stop now I'll just offend more people so I will say this, those are the big ones, those are the obvious ones."
R,We know about those towns.
R,"But I've also had occasion to visit some of the towns like Summer Shade and Thousand Sticks and Possum Trot and Pig, that's literally the name of the town, Pig."
R,Rabbit Hatch and others.
R,...
R,There's a lot of them.
R,And I tell you we're blessed; this is an extraordinary state.
R,"You think about it, you come from all corners of the state."
R,And I thank those of you who have done so.
R,"You come from the corners of this state and you appreciate not only that that is distinct to your area, but that which makes us great."
R,The riverways and the roadways that we have like nowhere else.
R,The geographic location we have like nowhere else.
R,"The fact that we are blessed with an abundance of water, an abundance of coal, an abundance of timber."
R,"Things that are the envy of other states, and of other nations around the world."
R,We have an abundance of resources.
R,We have a wonderful blend of Southern graciousness and hospitality melded with Midwestern sensibilities all smack dab in the middle of the greatest nation on the face of this Earth.
R,We are blessed in Kentucky.
R,We truly are.
R,This is also a state where you can in the course of a couple of hours travel from Boston to California and if you add an extra 30 minutes you can swing though London and Paris probably on your way in doing so.
R,So we are blessed in many respects.
R,"There's a big difference, though, between campaigning and governing."
R,During the course of a campaign you spend a whole lot of time talking about that which differentiates you from others.
R,"And while I did get a little bit of grief from some along the way for trying to focus less on the differentiation and more on that which unites us, none the less, even as I ran both in the primary and the general you talk about the differences."
R,"My challenge to you now as Kentuckians, as your governor, my challenge to each and every one of you is to focus on that which unites us."
R,Look at this seal that is in front of me.
R,Look at this seal that is behind us.
R,"Look at this seal that is on every one of our state flags, our state motto, ""United We Stand, Divided We Fall."""
R,Do you believe that?
R,Do you believe it?
R,Do you believe that this is true?
R,"I want to ask each and every one of you say this with me: united we stand, divided we fall."
R,One more time.
R,Say it like you mean it.
R,"United we stand, divided we fall."
R,How true it is.
R,The power to stand united is within each and every one of us.
R,This is our Kentucky.
R,This is our opportunity.
R,This is our ability to become the greatest version of ourselves that we could possibly be.
R,But it is going to come from each and every one of you.
R,It is going to be intentional.
R,We have challenges ahead.
R,True enough.
R,"I could run through a whole litany of things, a few of them you know."
R,"We are 46th in per capita income, but I will tell Kentucky is better than that."
R,"We're 47th in workforce participation, but I'll tell you, Kentucky is better than that."
R,"We have the highest level of unfunded pension liability in America, but Kentucky is better than that."
R,We are better than that.
R,"Tragically, we have the seventh-highest number of young people who overdose on drugs in this state."
R,In absolute numbers even though we're not a large state.
R,But Kentucky is better than that.
R,We are a state that has one out of every four individuals on Medicaid.
R,But Kentucky is better than that.
R,"There are many things that I could run through, but I'll tell you right now we know what they are, we experience them, we feel them, we know what they are but we know we are better than that."
R,"And the question we have to ask ourselves is that, if indeed we are better than that, how is it that we are going to become the greatest version of who we are?"
R,How will we move from where we are to some greater version still as we move into the future?
R,"I've been asked many times on this campaign trail, why I would want to be governor of the state of Kentucky."
R,Why would I want to step forward to lead the commonwealth?
R,"And what I said from the first time I've been asked to every other time as well, that it isn't so much a function as to what I want but rather that I am willing."
R,I am willing to step forward.
R,I am willing to lead this commonwealth.
R,And there are those that have gathered to prepare what we are experiencing right now.
R,Those that have stepped forward to serve this nation in uniform.
R,Those of you who even now are standing guard on our flank as armed officers.
R,People who are protecting and serving even now.
R,These are people who have also have been willing.
R,In order to be the best version of ourselves it will require us to give.
R,"It requires those us to step up to be willing to step beyond our conform zone and protect those around us by giving, by sacrificing."
R,"Our founding fathers talked about giving their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honors."
R,They talked about pledging these things but each and every one them gave some or all of these things.
R,"When they pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honors this was not a bumper sticker."
R,They weren't trying to win an election.
R,They meant it.
R,Every one of them meant it.
R,They gave some or all of these things.
R,We say we want a better Kentucky.
R,We say we want a better America.
R,My challenge to each and every one of you: How badly do you want it?
R,"How badly do you want it because if you don't want it enough to give some modicum of sacrifice, something from yourself that even remotely compares to that of those which proceeded us have given, those veterans we have honored, those fallen heroes that have fallen in the line of serving those police officers, those first-line responders, those firemen, those EMS."
R,Folks that are representing us.
R,"If we are not willing to give like them, we will not have a better Kentucky."
R,"We will not have a better America and, frankly, we don't deserve it."
R,But we have it within us to be better than this.
R,We do.
R,And my challenge to you is to recognize that the choices that we make today will affect our lives for generations to come.
R,Why should we be willing?
R,Look around you.
R,I have to look only to my left and I see nine compelling reasons for me to be willing to give.
R,"Look around yourselves, there are children in every row."
R,Some of you'll allow you to decide which is the child.
R,"But there are children among us, this is why we are doing this."
R,"We have an obligation, we have a responsibility but, frankly, this is the very thing that is unique about America."
R,Is that we have always been willing to peacefully transfer and sacrifice as if it wasn't going to be transferred peacefully.
R,I want to take a moment and challenge each and every one of you to challenge all Kentuckians everywhere.
R,"In 2016 and beyond, I want you to focus on living out the golden rule."
R,Treat people the way you want to be treated.
R,It's not that complicated.
R,"I encourage you please, extend a hand."
R,"Even when you leave here, simple things like if you brought garbage with you, take it out."
R,"I know that someone else is going to be paid to pick up behind you, but whether it here or at a state park or just on the sidewalk, treat our commonwealth with the pride you take in your new automobile or your new television set or your own living room."
R,We owe this to one another; we're all Kentuckians.
R,This is our commonwealth.
R,Help a neighbor.
R,"Make a point of befriending someone who's in a different political party than yourself and you don't agree on anything, find something you agree on."
R,Find a way to unite with them because united we stand and divided we fall.
R,It's as true as that.
R,It really is.
R,And my challenges to you is to take that seriously.
R,"When I received the nomination back in May, I asked during the acceptance speech if any of you recognized, as I did, that this was morning in Kentucky."
R,I truly believe it is.
R,"But I issued a challenge to you at that time and I asked you, as Kentuckians, that if indeed this is morning in Kentucky, I asked, were you willing to get up?"
R,"Were you willing to wake up, to get out of bed, to put your boots on and get about the business of the day?"
R,And you answered that challenge.
R,"You responded overwhelmingly on November 3rd when you went to the ballot box and you spoke with a loud and clear voice that you are ready to get up, you are ready for a fresh start, that you are ready to get about the day in this new day that is dawning in Kentucky."
R,And my hat is off to you for that.
R,"I was struck by something shortly after this election, in November."
R,"A couple of days later I was in Hazard, Kentucky, in Perry County."
R,I went to see a private-sector employer.
R,It was an individual who employs a number of people in that community.
R,I had met him during the course of the campaign.
R,"As we were walking out to the truck, after I had met with him and a number of his employees, he said to me, but almost half to himself and half to me, he said, ""You know you're the first one that has ever come back."""
R,I was struck by that.
R,I mention that to you only to challenge you.
R,"Let us be the state that is comprised of citizens who, at every turn, whether we are elected to serve you or whether you are citizens in the ranks of your community, your churches, your schools, whatever the case might be, within your very own family, be the ones who go back."
R,Let us be the ones who go back.
R,This will differentiate us.
R,This will make us the greatest version of ourselves that we could possibly be.
R,"Let us be known as the Commonwealth of Kentucky, where people go the extra mile, not only for one another, but for strangers who come through, for businesses who would come here, let us be the ones who go back."
R,This is my challenge to you in 2016.
R,This is what I will do my best to exemplify and model for you as your governor.
R,But this is within the power of every single one of us.
R,"Because while it may seem small, the ripple effect of small things is extraordinary."
R,You think about it.
R,It would be extraordinary.
R,"Policy issues
I don't want to spend a bunch of time talking about policy."
R,"Although I know if I don't say something about policy, I'll disappoint all these people that are standing on the risers."
R,So I will say a couple of things.
R,"I will simply say this: When we announced our candidacy 10-11months ago, two weeks after I first filed to run for governor, I put out what I called a Blueprint for a Better Kentucky."
R,And that blueprint was comprised of a number of things.
R,And we talked about those things on the campaign trail.
R,"And in the course of talking about those things, there were always the questions, ""Well, are they just saying that to get votes?"""
R,"I don't think it took people long to realize most of what I was saying was clearly not being said to curry favor because it was actually not well received, at least not by those on the risers."
R,Although you all clearly had a difference of opinion and my hat is off to you for that.
R,"And it isn't that we don't love those on the risers, because we do."
R,"They were just very wrong, because they didn't know what you all were thinking about."
R,"But here's the reality, and that's OK."
R,"But there were those who thought, well, maybe you're just saying this, maybe you're just saying that."
R,"We talked about auditing the pension plans and I will tell you, we are going to audit every single pension plan in the commonwealth of Kentucky."
R,"We talked about changing our retirement plans, the pension plans themselves, to ensure that we save them, so that we honor the commitment to our retirees and our current employees, and we are going to do that."
R,"Because to do anything less than that is a disservice to those not yet employed, those currently employed and those who are retired."
R,We will ensure that none of them get any of the promises made if we don't made hard decisions.
R,And we will make those hard decisions and we will save our pension plans for those who have earned them.
R,We talked about streamlining government and we have already begun.
R,And it will continue; stay tuned.
R,We are going to do it within each cabinet.
R,I am blessed by the caliber of men and women who have stepped forward.
R,"It is unbelievable, the depth of talent we have in our cabinet."
R,"And I'm grateful, I'm humbled."
R,I've always said I want to be the weakest link in the chain.
R,"So far, so good."
R,"I can tell you that right now, starting with my lieutenant governor, Jenean Hampton, really and truly."
R,"I really am the weakest link in the chain, and I'm grateful to be."
R,We've got amazing individuals who are going to work on your behalf.
R,We talked about modernizing and simplifying our tax code.
R,Time will tell exactly the specifics of that and we'll be rolling out a budget here in just a matter of less than two months.
R,But we are going to modernize and simplify our tax code.
R,We are going to get rid of the inventory tax in this state.
R,We are going to get rid of the death tax in this state.
R,We are going to get rid of the very things that frankly send the message to the outside world that we're not serious about being a business-friendly state.
R,"We're going to break those things down and we're going to turn this state into the type of place that people not only want to come to, but they want to stay."
R,We are already.
R,We could be much greater indeed.
R,We talked about federal overreach.
R,"I mean, you've heard it a thousand times and we'll talk about it more."
R,"But there's not going to be a day in our administration where we allow the tail of a regulatory agency in Washington, D.C., to wag the dog of Kentucky."
R,I will tell you that right now.
R,"Without giving you a long diatribe, the 10th Amendment is a very specific and powerful amendment."
R,"It says those established powers that are not specifically given to the federal government are the responsibility of the states and of the people and we are going to exercise that sovereignty, exercise that authority."
R,"And we are going to stand on our rights, and we are going to do what is correct and best for the people of Kentucky."
R,That is what we're going to do.
R,We talked about health care.
R,"We talked about the fact that we're going to transition in 2016 people from the state-level exchange, we're going to transfer them to the federal exchange like 38 other states are now doing, and we're going to shut that redundant program down."
R,This is what we're going to do next year.
R,"And as it relates to our Medicaid population which is very, very high, as you know."
R,More than 25 percent of those in our state and growing.
R,That is not because there is not need.
R,There is tremendous need; we know that.
R,We need to be those who address this in a thoughtful intelligent way.
R,It's truly a privilege to me to have Governor Pence here with us today.
R,"Where are you, Governor?"
R,There you are.
R,This is a model that we are going to copy.
R,I am not above copying what other people are doing well.
R,And there are great things being done on how to take care of those on Medicaid in the state of Indiana.
R,We can learn from them; we will learn from them.
R,"And I attempt to copy the best of what they're doing, and avoid any mistakes they may have made thus far."
R,This is what we're going to do.
R,"And I tell you, we will be better for it."
R,And our people will be better for it.
R,And we will provide true access to the health care system and not just lip service.
R,"Having a Medicaid card is of no value if you don't have a doctor that will see you, let's be honest."
R,"And if it comes at a price we can't afford, all we have done is lie to people, and we're better than that."
R,Kentucky is better than that.
R,"School choice
We talked about school choice."
R,This is one of seven states where there is no competition for public education dollars.
R,That is going to end.
R,We are not doing as well as we could be.
R,And let me say this.
R,"When I came up Capitol Avenue the most enthusiastic group of people I saw, and they were awesome, and I had more fun with them than any of the rest of you, were a group of school kids and they were public school students."
R,"And they had signs, and they were proud of the fact that they were."
R,And they ought to be.
R,Because we're got great public schools here in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
R,We truly do.
R,"We've got great teachers, and we've got great administrators, and we have great superintendents, and principals, and people who have a passion for seeing young people become the best versions of themselves."
R,"And we are going to unleash that power, because there is nothing that does so like competition."
R,"Competition is good, it is healthy."
R,Iron sharpens iron.
R,And we are going to remove the bureaucracy that comes from the suffocation of regulations and things that are detrimental to actually creating the educational environment that we want.
R,And we'll start with public charter schools.
R,"We'll start with public schools taught by public school teachers with public school students, like those I met, attending them."
R,"But we're going to start to bring school choice to the state of Kentucky, and we will let the momentum carry forward because we owe nothing less to our young people."
R,We talked about prioritizing our discretionary funding.
R,All I'll say briefly is that we cannot become the best version of ourselves if we don't focus on two things.
R,We must focus on education and we must focus on infrastructure.
R,"No state can become a better version of itself, of better relative to those states around it, if they do not focus on education and infrastructure."
R,"And with the limited dollars that we have, that's exactly what we're going to do."
R,I will say this.
R,"It's also time, while this wasn't in the blueprint, for us to truly change our tenor, the discourse with which we conduct ourselves politically."
R,I said this from the stage at Fancy Farm.
R,"And ironically, because I didn't choose to attack people at Fancy Farm as those others who were there felt it was their right, and prerogative and requirement to do - I was attacked, interestingly, for not attacking."
R,"Let me tell you, Kentucky is better than that too."
R,Let us treat one another with respect.
R,Let us treat one another with the kind of cordiality that we would want to be treated.
R,"Just as we said a moment ago, Kentucky is better than that."
R,Let's change the discourse.
R,"Let us treat one another in a way that rises above partisanship, because Kentucky is better than that."
R,I pray for two things for my children.
R,I pray this repeatedly.
R,"I pray it with them, and I pray this for them when I'm not with them."
R,"It's the very things that I pray for each and every one of you that are assembled here, the very things that I pray for our commonwealth as a whole."
R,"I pray that my children will have the wisdom of Solomon, that they will have the wisdom to know the difference between what is right and what is wrong."
R,Because we live in a mixed up world.
R,"We are sending crazy messages to young people in particular, that good is bad and in is out and right is wrong and up is down."
R,We're confusing them.
R,And I pray that my children and that your children will know the difference between what is right and what is wrong.
R,But the second thing that I pray for them is that in addition to knowing the right thing to do -- and this is my prayer for each and every one of you as well -- that you will also have and they will have the courage to do the right thing.
R,Because knowing the right thing is not always as difficult as doing the right thing.
R,"It is my prayer for each and every one of you that you will know what is right, and you will do what is right."
R,Courage comes in many forms.
R,Courage for many of you came in the form of you going to the ballot box on November 3rd.
R,I met a gentlemen down here at the bottom of the hill who told me he's a military veteran.
R,"The first time he has ever voted in his life, and he's probably 50-some years old, was in this past election."
R,I appreciated his courage in telling me that.
R,I appreciated his courage in exercising the right that he risked his life for.
R,He was a veteran.
R,"These are the kinds of things that I applaud you for, that I'm grateful for."
R,But it is that courage that was exercised at the ballot box.
R,"And when I see 106 out of 120 counties, we could interpret that in a whole lot of ways."
R,"And we could feel good about that, and we could feel extra special about ourselves, as if somehow we had the right message."
R,"And arguably the message did resonate with you, but I'll tell you what I see when I see that electoral map."
R,I see a cry for help.
R,That's what I see.
R,"And I want you to know that I hear that cry for help, from every corner of this great commonwealth."
R,I'm listening.
R,"Our ears will be open, our doors will be open."
R,This is your house.
R,This is your commonwealth.
R,"Today, Dec. 8, 2015, we begin a fresh start together, as one Kentucky."
R,"Black, white, rural, urban, Democrat, Republican, Independent, people who come from both ends of the socio-economic spectrum, male, female, young and old alike."
R,"This is our Kentucky, this is our time."
R,This is our opportunity.
R,Together we will accomplish great things.
R,"Together we will serve as a beacon to our fellow Kentuckians, to those who are here assembled and to those that we will cross paths with as we leave this place."
R,"And we will serve as a beacon to the rest of our nation, and to the rest of our world as well."
R,"And we will do this, because we are Kentucky, and because we are better than that."
R,I thank you for coming here today.
R,"I thank you for being assembled here, for being willing to take this challenge and run with it."
R,"I ask that you will take this away, that you will live the golden rule, and I leave you with this."
R,"It is truly my hope and prayer as well, that God will continue to shed his grace upon the great Commonwealth of Kentucky and our old Kentucky home."
R,"Thank you, and God bless you."
R,"Thank you, thank you."
R,"Thank you, very, very much."
R,"President Chaisson, Speaker Tucker, statewide elected officials, Chief Justice Calogero and Justices of the Supreme Court; Members of the legislature; Governor Treen, Governor Foster, Governor Roemer, Governor Blanco, Governor Perry; Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter; Congressman McCrery, Congressman Boustany, Melancon, Congressman Alexander; my beautiful wife, Supriya, my children, my family; honored guests, friends, my fellow Louisianians:

It is with gratitude in my heart and determination in my spirit that I stand before you today."
R,Thanks be to Almighty God.
R,"It is great to be with you today, a milestone on what is a long and important journey."
R,"We come to the steps of this historic Capitol today to celebrate, celebrate not just an election, but a new beginning."
R,"We're not here for one man to take an oath, but for one people to make commitments to each other."
R,"We are here not to inaugurate one administration opposite from those before, but to set forth together, all of us, towards a new era."
R,"For reasons none of us can understand or even fully appreciate, history has placed all of us -- every living Louisianian, those within her borders and without -- in a position previous generations could only envy."
R,"Under the spotlight of the world, with generosity from many and a clear call to common purpose, we have the opportunity to make lasting and positive change."
R,"We have the opportunity -- We have the opportunity to make this change not over the course of decades, but in short order."
R,"We have the opportunity to affect not just our own children's lives, but the lives of Louisiana children yet to be born."
R,We have the opportunity -- born of tragedy but embraced still the same -- to make right decades of failure in government.
R,"You've often heard me say, we don't live -- we don't live in a poor state; we've had a state with poor leadership; that we do not have a state stuck in the past, but leaders who were unconcerned with the future."
R,"If we are honest with ourselves, we can all agree that too many of those stereotypes rang true."
R,"In our past, too many of our politicians looked out for themselves."
R,Too many arms of state and local government did not get results.
R,And the world took note.
R,Those stereotypes cost us credibility.
R,They cost us investment.
R,They cost us jobs.
R,"Let us all resolve today -- Democrats and Republicans, North Louisiana and South, leaders of all -- all races and all religions, elected and unelected -- let us all resolve that era ends today."
R,We can build a Louisiana where our leaders and our people set the highest standards and hold every member of our government accountable; a Louisiana where incompetence is not a synonym for government; a Louisiana where corruption does not hold us back.
R,That is why I'm asking for your help -- I'm asking for your help in the next few months.
R,We must win a war on corruption and incompetence in government.
R,It cannot be the last thing we do -- It cannot be the last thing we do.
R,It cannot be the second or third thing we do.
R,"It must be the first thing we do, starting today."
R,Our biggest obstacle in the past must become our first victory towards a brighter future.
R,"Today, I'm here to tell you that on February 10th -- just weeks from today -- I will call the legislature into special session to consider comprehensive ethics reform."
R,And I need your help to insist that we get the job done.
R,We will come to this Capitol -- We will come to this Capitol to make a clean break with the past; to give Louisiana the highest standards for accountability anywhere in the nation; to take our government 180 degrees from the darkest chapters of its past.
R,"When we have accomplished ethics reform, we will move next to economic reform."
R,"For too long our regulations, our burdensome taxes, have driven away job-makers instead of attracting them."
R,Our workforce training has stayed grounded in the economy of a century now past.
R,That too must change.
R,We have great workers.
R,We have great people -- with a great work ethic that is part of our culture.
R,"It is time for our state government to catch up, so that there is no weak link in our appeal to employers looking to grow."
R,I will ask our legislature this year to re-orient our workforce training to meet the challenges and skills required by the global economy.
R,And our administration will streamline its demand of job-makers.
R,"Our message will be clear: If you want to grow your company, Louisiana wants to grow with you -- with a guarantee that state government will be your ally, and that our workers will be ready to do your high-skill jobs on their very first day."
R,These reforms are essential to our turnaround.
R,We can't -- We cannot settle for cosmetic change.
R,And we all must recognize the stakes.
R,"When we succeed, the world will take note."
R,They will take note in the laboratories of Silicon Valley.
R,They will take note in the board rooms of Wall Street.
R,"And they will take note in the living rooms scattered across Houston and Atlanta and Dallas -- where former Louisianians now live, many of them our best and brightest, in exile from an uncertain future at home."
R,We must bring them home.
R,"That capital, that energy, those assets: They are all poised to come to Louisiana and help us remake our economy."
R,"If we make a clean start, they will come."
R,"In some ways, this focus on ethics is meant to be a beacon."
R,"And we must light that beacon to inspire Louisianians everywhere, whether they live in Monroe or Manhattan, Franklinton or Florida, Tensas or Texas."
R,"You see, the fire and drive of Louisianians -- they're the only things that can power our rebirth."
R,"Fortunately, we are blessed."
R,It is possible that there has never been a more creative group of people than the group called Louisianians.
R,"No one anywhere in the world doubts our talents, our creative energy."
R,They wait in lines to listen to our music.
R,They revere our athletes.
R,(Geaux Tigers!)
R,They marvel at our state's film and visual arts.
R,They envy our celebrations and flock to them every year.
R,And they all try to imitate our cuisine.
R,"Across the entire civilized world, when it comes to culture, the word ""Louisiana"" stands for innovation and quality."
R,"Those talents, given by God and nurtured by a community that values creativity, will enable us to turn our state around."
R,"Wherever you are today hearing my voice, to my fellow Louisianians -- those gathered here at the Capitol, to those inside our borders and outside -- I ask you to come home."
R,Come home in person; or send home your commitment.
R,Make Louisiana's rebirth your own priority.
R,"If you're a Louisiana small business owner trying to get started, stick it out another year."
R,"If you own companies in other states, grow your business here."
R,"If you teach in our schools, if you serve your community, redouble your efforts."
R,Join in our cause.
R,Make every day not just a job but a mission.
R,"With clarity of purpose and commitment to our pursuit, we will not fail."
R,And let me be clear -- let me be clear exactly about the kind of New Louisiana I envision.
R,I don't speak of a state that simply rebuilds to where we were before the storms.
R,"The truth is, too many of our schools were failing before the storms."
R,Our roads were substandard before the storms.
R,"Our economy was behind, before the storms."
R,"And now, for reasons beyond our earthly comprehension, this opportunity, this mandate, has been placed on our generation."
R,We must rise to this challenge.
R,"Our goal is a New Louisiana where success is shared by all Louisianians: not just our cities, not just our suburbs, not just one group or one class -- but everyone who believes in Louisiana."
R,"A vibrant economy and high-performing schools are things that every Louisiana community deserves, from the Delta to the Bayou."
R,"This -- This Louisiana will not come easily, but it will come."
R,It can happen.
R,It can change.
R,It must change.
R,It will change.
R,"To Congressman McCrery, I want to thank you for those heartfelt remarks."
R,"I want to thank you for your friendship, for your service to our great state."
R,"To governor Foster, the other governors assembled here, I want to thank you for your service to our state."
R,"To governor Blanco, to coach Blanco, I want to thank to your service to our state during perhaps the most difficult and trying times we could ever imagine in our lifetimes."
R,I want to thank you for your service and your graciousness.
R,"To my parents, to my wife, to my children and my family, I thank you for your support and your prayers."
R,"To speaker Chaisson -- I'm sorry president Chaisson, speaker Tucker, the Members of the legislature, I look forward to working with you in partnership to delivering the New Louisiana our citizens so richly deserve and so strongly demand."
R,"I will close by offering you this reflection: Two centuries ago, Louisiana was the economic focal point of the entire country."
R,"Just as the water of the rivers in America flowed to Louisiana, so flowed the harvest of America to Louisiana."
R,"It built one of the world's great cities, and a magnet for entrepreneurs and innovators and capitalists."
R,"In today's world, the great harvest in our economy is not measured in bushels and bales, but in brainpower."
R,"In the knowledge-based economy of this century, investment and opportunity flow to places where the workforce is prepared, the business climate welcoming."
R,"In short, the opportunities flow to places focused on the future and driven to do something about it."
R,"That is how we will run our New Louisiana government:

- Twenty-first century schools and colleges."

R,"Our New Louisiana will be a magnet for the dreamers, the risk-takers, the adventurers, the leaders of America's new economy."
R,"That Louisiana, that New Louisiana will give our citizens the opportunities they deserve."
R,That is the kind of reform we will bring.
R,That is our goal.
R,That is our charge.
R,"I've said it before and I'll say it once more again: We can change, We must change, We will change."
R,Thank you!
R,God Bless you!
R,God Bless the Great State of Louisiana!
R,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 125th Legislature, Governor Baldacci, former Governors King, McKernan, Brennan and honored guests."
R,Welcome.
R,Mainers have a long tradition of working together.
R,As I begin I would like to thank John Baldacci.
R,"John, Karen and his entire administration have done all we have asked to make this transition a success."
R,"Ann and I are very grateful, and we join all Mainers in thanking the Baldaccis for their service to city, state and nation."
R,"Like every proud dad and husband, I did not need to take the oath of office to believe I have Maine’s first family."
R,"But now that it is official, let me thank Ann and my children for their love and support during the last 16 months."
R,"First and Foremost, I am a businessman who served his community as a Mayor and now as Governor."
R,"My pledge to the Maine People is to put you before politics:

The parents trying to make a better life for their kids; The retirees trying to hold onto their homes on a fixed income;

The college graduate trying to find a good paying job; The entrepreneurs with the courage to take a chance on an idea; and

The taxpayers tired of footing the bill for a bloated establishment in Augusta."
R,It is time to make state government accountable.
R,It is time to deliver value.
R,It is time to put people first.
R,"The word “people,” appears in the Maine Constitution 49 times."
R,"You cannot find a single mention of the words “politics,” “Republican,” “Democrat,” “Green,” or “Independent” in 37 pages of preambles, articles and sections of our State Constitution."
R,The framers had it right.
R,People come before politics.
R,"Partisan affiliations, political leanings and the obsession with winning and losing have been getting in the way of solving Maine problems."
R,We need a new approach and it starts right here and right now!
R,I am willing to listen and work constructively with anyone committed to honest solutions that benefit all Maine people.
R,"To ensure I get plenty of input, I will be hosting monthly breakfast meetings with groups of teachers, business leaders and environmental leaders."
R,Oatmeal and solutions will be on the menu.
R,I will re-introduce Governor McKernan’s “Capitol for a day program” where town hall meetings are held in each of Maine’s 16 counties.
R,We are going to get around and learn from the people of Maine.
R,I will host constituent service hours to meet directly with the people of Maine.
R,"Come in and share your concerns, tell me about your ideas and, if we disagree, we can look for common ground so we can move Maine forward."
R,"While I will listen to anyone, my Administration will be focused on making Maine work for everyone."
R,"There will be no favorites, carve outs, or favors for the special interests."
R,Good policy is public policy for everyone.
R,There is no greater example of serving the common good than the sacrifice of our service men and women.
R,"The peaceful transfer of power, our rights and our liberties are not free."
R,They are earned each and every day by those who serve.
R,Forty-Six service members from Maine have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our state and our nation in the last seven years.
R,I am honored that some of the families of our fallen heroes are here today.
R,Dan and Suzanne Brochu along with their daughter Sadie are with us.
R,They lost Private First Class Jordan Brochu in Afghanistan in August of 2009.
R,"Starting tomorrow, Suzanne will be the receptionist in my office at the State House."
R,The family of Corporal Andrew Hutchins of New Portland is also with us.
R,Corporal Hutchins gave his life in service to Maine and the Nation last November in Afghanistan.
R,"Corporal Hutchins’ wife Heather is due to give birth to their first child, Allyssa Braelynn, in March."
R,All of Maine shares the sorrow of the families of our fallen heroes and we all honor their service to protect our liberties.
R,Please join me in a moment of silence to honor the sacrifices of our fallen heroes and to reflect on the loss their family members continue to endure so each of us can be free.
R,Thank You.
R,One area where we must put politics and specials interests aside is education.
R,Students are the most important people in the classroom.
R,Every decision we make and every dollar we spend must be focused on the individualized needs of our kids.
R,"Our standards need to be high, administration must be lean and we have to make sure we find solutions that work for all students."
R,I believe we need to make vocational education a priority again in our schools.
R,Training our young people in a trade while they earn their diploma is a path to a good living.
R,I believe we also need to create five year high schools in Maine where students can graduate with an associate’s degree that is a leg up for entering the workforce.
R,"And these credits can be transferred into our four year degree universities, reducing the time and expense of earning a college degree in Maine."
R,"Approximately one in every three Mainers is on some form of state or local government assistance for food, shelter, income or health care."
R,"For the truly needy and impaired, these programs are an important life line that combines with charitable programs, churches and the individual generosity of Mainers to form the safety net for a healthy society."
R,"While we have a generous spirit in Maine, we do not have limitless resources."
R,"Our programs have to be focused on Maine residents, we must make every effort to move people from dependency to self-sufficiency and we must have a tiered system that rewards work and progress."
R,And we have to have a five year time limit so kids in Maine grow up in families where self-reliance and work are a way of life.
R,"I recently met Jennifer Cloukey, a single mother of four and a full time nursing student."
R,"Like me, Jennifer has escaped domestic violence."
R,Jennifer works two or three jobs at any given time but also has to rely on Temporary Assistant to Needy Families and the Food Supplement Program to make ends meet for her family.
R,"Seven years ago, she built a home for herself and her kids through Habitat for Humanity."
R,Jennifer was determined to be a good example for her kids and other single moms.
R,This coming May she will graduate from Nursing School.
R,Nearly every day someone asks Jen how she does it.
R,She tells all that will listen that a life well lived does not happen all at once.
R,"Today, Jennifer, all of Maine is listening and I am proud to share your story."
R,"In my administration your example will be our goal, and eventually the norms."
R,Please join me in recognizing Jennifer Cloukey.
R,Maine is the hardest place in the country to start and grow a business.
R,"Consequently, we earn just 80% of the national per capital income and we are failing to make the investments needed to grow our tax base."
R,Only the private sector can create the jobs and investment we need to move Maine forward.
R,Profit is not a dirty word.
R,In fact it is the direct and indirect solution to all of our challenges.
R,The search for profit is what drives investment and innovation.
R,"Without profit, no one has an incentive to create jobs or build our tax base."
R,Profit is what will keep our young people from leaving Maine in search of better opportunities.
R,Profit is what makes the public sector possible.
R,"Without profit, we do not have economic activity, we do not have income and we do not have a tax base."
R,Profit pays the bills for every sector of society.
R,Profit leads to more competition.
R,And through competition “We the People” end up with more choice and greater value.
R,"Every private or public sector job, every program, every non-profit, every state service and every advancement in society started because someone took a nickel worth of input and turned it into a dime of output."
R,It is a trend that has to continue.
R,Here is a four step process of how we are going to do it.
R,Simplicity: It needs to get a lot easier to do business in Maine.
R,"We are now conducting a state-wide Red Tape removal audit to identify the statutes, rules and bureaucratic road blocks to job creation in Maine."
R,"We can have vigorous protections for what makes Maine so great as long as the safeguards are clear, decisions are quick and we have a cooperative relationship between regulators and the private sector."
R,Savings: It needs to be less expensive to do business in Maine.
R,"Everything from the cost of licensing a business to health care, workers compensation and utility costs needs to go down."
R,Business is just math.
R,It is the same for everyone whether you’re an international player in the paper industry or a corner deli fighting to reach the breakeven point.
R,The costs that we can control through public policy need to go down.
R,"Our forests, fisheries and farmland will never reach their full economic potential in Maine if it is cheaper elsewhere to operate factories that turn wood into paper, process fish into a meal and turn potatoes into chips and fries."
R,Skills: We need to train the next generation of workers in Maine in the industries that offer the most potential.
R,"We have one of the world’s best Science and Math magnet schools in Limestone, Maine."
R,"Motivated teachers, motivated students and affordable access make it all work."
R,"Representative Terry Hayes, the Assistant Democratic Leader in the Maine House of Representatives is a proud magnet school mom."
R,Her son Danny participated in a one-week summer program and applied for enrollment in the magnet school because of his interest in math and science.
R,Today Danny is a Dean’s list engineering student at the University of Maine who aspires to live and work in Maine as a mechanical engineer.
R,"Let’s work together to make sure Danny Hayes, and others like him, can stay close to home and prosper."
R,"Scale: We need to provide our industries with competitive advantages in terms of costs, regulatory environment and trained labor that give Maine businesses a leg up over the global competition."
R,We are fighting for the future of Maine and every decision we make has to be considered in these terms.
R,That is how you achieve competitive advantage.
R,"If we can make Maine a place where it is once again cost effective to make paper or process potatoes, we are going to have the business climate that attracts new economy jobs in information technology, biotechnology and semi-conductors as well."
R,It is about balance.
R,"We can find balance in life, if we work together."
R,I ran for Governor because I know how to run a business and create jobs.
R,"In my experience you pick your team, make your decisions and you stand accountable for things that matter."
R,"I will spend every day of the next four years working to make Maine a better place for ALL of our sons and daughters to find work, to start businesses and to stay here to start families of their own."
R,A Governor cannot do it alone.
R,"It is going to take hard work from everyone, but I am ready to provide the leadership and focus needed to move us forward."
R,"I do not care about editorials, opinion polls or the next election."
R,I have four years and a job to do.
R,At the end of my term I will be ready to stand accountable for the job we did at putting people first and creating prosperity for working Maine families.
R,"Being Governor is not about me, my administration, the Legislature or Augusta bureaucrats."
R,"It is about Maine people, and I will let you be the judge."
R,Thank you for coming.
R,Thank you for listening.
R,Now let’s get to work for all Maine people.
R,"""Mr. President and Members of the Senate, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, Lieutenant Governor Politoand Members of the Governor's Council and the Cabinet, Chief Justice Gants and Members of the Judiciary, Former Massachusetts Governors Weld, Swift and Romney, Reverend Clergy."
R,"""Jan Cellucci and Angela Menino -I've known and admired you both for many years."
R,And remain a huge fan of the energy and joy your husbands’ brought to public service.
R,And other distinguished guests -My thanks to all of you for being here today.
R,"""To my fellow citizens, it's with great humility and high honor that I assume the office of Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts."
R,"""I'm well aware of the authority and privileges that come with this office."
R,But they're inconsequential in comparison to the responsibility of serving and protecting the people of this great state.And the obligation to always live up to their trust.
R,"""The people have vested me with the title of Governor for the next four years."
R,But I also hold other lifelong titles that I'm proud of.
R,Son.
R,Brother.
R,Husband.
R,Father.
R,And neighbor.
R,Those titles have shaped the values and vision that I bring to the corner office.
R,"""The Bible that I placed my left hand on a few minutes ago is the same one my mother held for my father 46 years ago."
R,When he was sworn in as Assistant Secretary under then U.S. Transportation Secretary and former Massachusetts Governor John Volpe.
R,"""At a moment like this there's no way for a son to properly thank his parents for all they've done for him."
R,"Dad, I can only say that I love you both."
R,You made me who I am today.
R,And I wish Mom could be here in person to see this with you.
R,"""I want to especially thank my wife Lauren."
R,"For her love, counsel, sense of humor and endless support."
R,I knew when we got married that I was a lucky guy.
R,But I know now 27 years and three wonderful children later that I've been truly blessed.
R,"""On behalf of the people of Massachusetts, I thank Governor Deval Patrick for his service over the past eight years."
R,And to wish him God speed.
R,"""I want to sincerely thank our public safety officers, first responders, and corrections officers for the work they do."
R,It's a service that's always challenging and at times very complicated.
R,And with very few exceptions these men and women do it every day with great skill and professionalism.
R,"""I also want to salute all those men and women from the Commonwealth who have or are serving in our country's armed forces."
R,Since 9-11 many citizens of Massachusetts have answered our nation's call to service and have served with distinction.
R,And when men and women serve so do their families.
R,We must never forget that.
R,"As Governor, these men and women and their families will always be in my prayers."
R,"""Finally, to the people of France, our thoughts are with you during this difficult time."
R,"""Our Commonwealth is filled with hardworking, talented and inspiring people."
R,"We're a global leader in health care, biotechnology, high technology, education, finance, energy efficiency and advanced manufacturing."
R,And we've led the way for the nation on issues ranging from health care reform to marriage equality.
R,"""But we're nowhere near our full potential."
R,Some of our toughest challenges have been ignored and lost amid the successes.
R,Or have become the equivalent of kicking a can down the road because they're not politically convenient oreasy to fix.
R,"""They range from having more than 1,500 homeless families assigned to hotels and motels."
R,To dozens of lapses in performance that are frustrating for many.
R,And in some cases devastating in their consequences.
R,"""I know we can do better."
R,"""The time has come to write the next chapter in the history of this great Commonwealth."
R,To build on what makes us great.
R,And get much better at what doesn't.
R,"""Lieutenant Governor Polito and I have recruited a talented, experienced, diverse and bipartisan cabinet and staff."
R,They will approach their mission with a passion and thoughtfulness to make Massachusetts great.
R,And they understand that policy pronouncements without follow through ---amount to empty promises.
R,"""Tom Menino taught us all many valuablelessons."
R,He believed that government was about high ideals.
R,But he also equally believed that basic services mattered and that every detail counted.
R,"""When people have to wait for hours to conduct a simple transaction at the Registry of Motor Vehicles they're not being served."
R,"""And when thousands of families continue to be confused and let down by the Health Connector we've not paid attention to the details."
R,"""Those are but two examples."
R,"""We will challenge the status quo, look for and try new approaches and recognize they might not always work."
R,"When that happens, we'll acknowledge it."
R,Learn from it.
R,And try again.
R,"""Our actions will be heard in many ways."
R,"But the loudest of these actions will initially be in dealing with an immediate budget deficit,building a job-creating economy, closing the achievement gap, confronting opiate addiction and revitalizing our urban centers."
R,"""With respect to the state's budget our Constitution requires that the budget be balanced."
R,No one understands that better thanI do.
R,The responsibility now rests with us.
R,"""History will record that a budget deficit exceeding half a billion dollars is being transferred to my administration."
R,"""If we're honest with ourselves then we can't blame our deficit on a lack of revenue."
R,We have to recognize that this is a spending problem.
R,And that dealing with it now will make balancing next year's budget that much easier.
R,"""We will hold the line on taxes, we're already demanding enough from hard working people."
R,And we will protect cities and towns and fulfill our promise to end the cuts to local aid.
R,"Otherwise, every line item will be looked at."
R,"""I look forward to working with House Speaker DeLeo, Senate President Rosenberg and the members of both legislative branches to close this gap."
R,"""While there are efficiencies to be gained and structural changes to be made there's no doubt that we have to make difficult decisions."
R,We will do so with great sensitivity and careful judgment.
R,"""Massachusetts has an unemployment rate of 5.8%."
R,"Butthat's a cold-hearted statistic that ignores the 200,000 people seeking work, the hundreds of thousands of underemployed, and the tens of thousands who have dropped out of the work force altogether."
R,"""There's no single initiative that can start and sustain a job creating economy."
R,"But there is clear evidence that we're too complex, too expensive, and too slow to move and make decisions."
R,On this we must do better.
R,"""Our administration will work to reduce red tape and streamline regulatory requirements on start-ups and established businesses."
R,And we'll report regularly on our progress.
R,"""Healthcare costs are an enormous burden on everyone, dragging down our collective ability to grow and hire more people."
R,We'll pursue many paths on this challenge.
R,"""But the simplest one -ensuring full price and performance transparency is long overdue."
R,"The same service in the same neighborhood, with the same outcome can vary in price by as much as 300 percent."
R,This must change.
R,"""There's also a direct link between economic growth and a sustainable and affordable supply of energy."
R,"""But as we begin the New Year, families and businesses across New England are being hit with unprecedented increases in their energy and electric bills."
R,At exactly the same time energy pricesacross the rest of the country are falling.
R,"This increase is being driven in large part by inadequate delivery systems, the result of poor planning and coordination."
R,"""I look forward to working with my colleagues here in Massachusetts and with leaders like Governor Raimondo of Rhode Island as well as the other New England Governors to solve this problem while we continue to reduce our carbon footprint."
R,"""I'm a proud product of the Massachusetts public schools."
R,"And to this day, I can still name almost every teacher I had growing up."
R,"They moved me, challenged me and made me feel like my opinion mattered."
R,"""Across Massachusetts, there are many talented and inspiring educators doing for their students what their predecessors did for me."
R,"""I was in Lawrenceyesterday witnessing firsthand the progress that's been made in just a few short years there."
R,"Despite all their issues, and they have many, a renaissance is underway in their public schools."
R,"""Attendance is up."
R,Dropout rates are down.
R,Test scores and graduation rates are up.
R,The school day is longer.
R,"""And Lawrence is hardly alone."
R,There are exceptional schools in many of our most disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout the Commonwealth.
R,"Proving they can get it done for kids, no matter what their circumstances."
R,"""But other schools really do need to step it up for the children and the families that they serve."
R,Poor performance given the dramatic success of other schools can no longer be tolerated.
R,"""And while traditional public schools will always be the backbone of our education, we need more high performing public charter schools in underperforming school districts to 
complement them."
R,"As I speak, there are more than 45,000 Bay State kids and their parents on waiting lists for these schools."
R,"""It's wrong for any of us to stand on a front porch or in a city neighborhood sympathizing with a mom or dad when they tell us their child is not getting the education to succeed in life and then oppose lifting the charter school cap or making the changes we need to ensure that every school is great."
R,"""Last year, Governor Patrick called opiate addiction a public health crisis."
R,He was right.
R,It is an epidemic.
R,One that cuts across every community in the Commonwealth.
R,"""Several months ago I met John and Stephanie Green of Easton."
R,After a routine medical procedure their 19-year-old son Evan was prescribed opiates for pain.
R,"Slowly and unknowingly, he became addicted to them."
R,When the prescription ended he turned to heroin.
R,"""Over a period of years, John and Stephanie tried as hard as any parents could to help their son."
R,"It was an agonizing, yet all too familiar story."
R,"Tragically, Evan fatally overdosed almost a year ago to this day."
R,"""As a parent, my heart goes out to John and Stephanie for their devastating loss."
R,"As Governor, I intend to tackle this problem head on because too many families have gone through the grief and pain that John and Stephanie have."
R,"""I look forward to working with Attorney General Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and manyothers on this issue."
R,Because without strong action many more individuals and families like the Greens will have the same terrible experience.
R,"""When Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito and I campaigned last year, we said we were chasing 100 percent of the vote."
R,And we campaigned hard in many communities of color.
R,"""We did so because we believe these neighborhoods have not benefitted from the economic success that has become more commonplace in other parts of our Commonwealth."
R,"""But there are inspiring points of light in these communities."
R,"Because individual economic development, education, community development and social service entrepreneurs are turning so-called lost causes into definite winners."
R,"""My friend and the Commonwealth's new Secretary for Business Development Nam Pham and the folks at VietAID worked with their neighbors to literally turn their 
neighborhood in Dorchester from a dangerous place into a community on the move -where businesses want to create jobs and families want to live."
R,"""Robert Lewis Jr. at The BASE in Roxbury has attracted millions of dollars in scholarships from colleges across the country."
R,These scholarships are designated for the young men from communities of color who participate in his baseball and mentoring program.
R,"""And the kids at United Teen Equality Center (UTEC) in Lowell are turning gang members into productive citizens through programs like their culinary institute."
R,"In talking about their success, their enthusiasm to do more is contagious."
R,Our problem is not that no one has figured out what works.
R,Just the opposite.
R,"""The entrepreneurs and leaders that I just mentioned as well as many others have cracked the code."
R,Our government just hasn't had the will or the foresight to support what they are doing anddo more of it.
R,"""The tragic events in Ferguson and New York City speak loudly."
R,And their message is a simple one.
R,"When people lose hope, bad things happen."
R,"""I've said a thousand times I want every community to be a place where people believe tomorrow isgoing to be better than today."
R,"I say that not just because I believe it, but because I believe in it."
R,"""The great writer and philosopher Samuel Johnson once said, “The natural flights of the human mind are not from pleasure to pleasure but from hope to hope.”    ""Put another way, if you think things are heading in the right direction, then you believe in and can't wait for tomorrow, no matter where you might be today."
R,"""And that faith in tomorrow needs to be based on something beyond the word of our Lord."
R,It has to include the here and now.
R,"The quality of the schools you send your kids to, the parks they play in, the main streets you can walk to from your house or apartment, the job you have and the future it offers to you and your family."
R,"""If we are to avoid the tragedies that make the front page --like Ferguson, as well as the ones that don't like the awful shooting death of Dawnn Jaffier, then it's imperative that we renew our commitment and re-double our efforts to provide everyone, no matter where they live with the kinds of opportunities that exist across our Commonwealth."
R,"""Decades ago, John F. Kennedy stood where I stand today when he delivered a farewell address to the General Court of Massachusetts before traveling to Washington D.C. to become our 35th President."
R,"""In that address, he said success in public service should be measured against four historic qualities: courage, judgment, integrity and dedication."
R,"""The President-elect defined these qualities for his time in office."
R,"Today, I offer them as this administration's compass in the years ahead -but redefined for our time."
R,"""First we must have courage to set partisanship aside and embrace the best ideas and solutions, no matter which side of the aisle they come from."
R,"""Second we must have judgment to make our government as efficient, responsive and innovative as it can be."
R,"""Third we must have integrity to assure accountability and transparency because when we make honest mistakes they must be acknowledged and corrected."
R,"""And finally we must have dedication to serve the best interest of the public and only the public."
R,"""It's undeniable that the ability and responsibility to make a real difference in the lives of people, a growing and competitive economy, quality and affordable educationfor our kids, responsible, forward looking environmental policy as well as strong and safe communities lies with and within us if we approach our work every day with courage, judgment, integrity and dedication."
R,"""Only by working together will we make Massachusetts great."
R,"With your help, I know we will."
R,"""God bless you all and God bless the Commonwealth of Massachusetts."
R,"""Thank you."""
R,I want to share one bit of family history with you.
R,"My maternal grandfather, Charles Howell, retired from the REO Motor Car Company."
R,So he took a position working in the Capitol during WW II.
R,He was the custodian.
R,"He ran the elevators, he was in charge of putting the flags up and down.My sister still fondly remembers rides on the elevator with him when she was very, very young."
R,"So it is with pride that our family has another member going to work in this institution, although I can say the elevator rides may not be as much fun."
R,"Let me turn now to our great state, and the power of Michigan."
R,Innovators and entrepreneurs were the leaders in the two major eras in our history.
R,"Fur trappers and traders, people in the iron and copperbusiness, people in the lumber and pewter industry."
R,They were the people who led us the way and showed us the power of Michigan in the natural resources era.
R,"Entrepreneurs such as Kellogg, Ford, Dow, Gerber and Upjohn."
R,The showed us the power of Michiganduring the industrial era.
R,The industrial era in our state will go down as one of the world’s great economic success stories.
R,It served as a catalyst to change not just our nation but the entire world.
R,"Unfortunately, the last part of the industrial era has been a period of decline in our state."
R,And it has gone on for several decades.
R,We have been shrinking relative to the rest of the country.
R,"To put it in perspective, in the 1960s we had our largest number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives at 19."
R,"In 2012, that number will drop to 14 –a loss of five seats over 40 years."
R,"To put that in perspective, in 2012 we will have lost more representation than over 20 states have in their entire delegation."
R,We’ve also become a poorer state in relation to the rest of the country.
R,"Our rank in per capita income was 18th in the year 2000, and the latest data shows us at 37."
R,But we are not here today to talk about the past.
R,We are here today to move into a bright future.
R,This election was a point of realization.It was a point where we understood where the old ways don’t work.
R,It is time to start a new era in our state’s history.
R,If we stayed on this current path we would continue to go downward.
R,This is our moment of opportunity to realize we have a bright future instead of a declining future.
R,As building blocks we have world class assets to build upon.
R,"Our natural resources, universities, our manufacturing and industrial base."
R,"And more importantly, our people."
R,President Abraham Lincoln was looking to America’sfuture during the darkest times of the Civil War when he said: “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to stormy present.
R,"The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise to the occasion."
R,"As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.” We can heed his words and enter this new year with a clean slate."
R,"Our legacy will be found in the future, the opportunity we create for Michigan’s coming generations."
R,"The underlying key to success, though, is to change our culture."
R,"We need to go from negative to positive, we need to stop looking in the rear view mirror and look toward the future."
R,We need to stop being divisive and start being inclusive.
R,We have spent too much time fighting among ourselves and have become our own worst enemy.
R,This will not be simple or easy.
R,There are no magic solutions to our problems.
R,But with those problems there also comes opportunity.
R,"I’ve been hired to represent all of the people of the State Michigan, and to move us all forward together."
R,It will require sharedsacrifice from all of us.
R,Many have already made sacrifices.
R,Many of us need to join those who already contributed.
R,When we make changes like this we are faced with the realization many of us will have to take a step back in the short term to move us all forward together in the long term.
R,"As part of the solution, we need to include everyone."
R,"Our solution has to address the issue, the challenge of keeping young people in this state."
R,"We must create more and better opportunities and jobs for the underemployed, and the structurally unemployed."
R,The reinvention of Michigan must not leave anyone behind.
R,We have a road map of how to achieve success.
R,"We campaigned on a bold vision, a concise plan and an attitude of action."
R,Clear and tangible steps.
R,"We must do morethan just ask the government to do things in a new way, we must ask our people to be part of the solution."
R,"As I traveled the state, in every corner of 
the state, I had mothers, fathers, grandparents come up to me and say, ‘Help us make this a place for our children to either stay or come back.’ And they also said, ‘How can help?’ It is about us all working together."
R,"Lansing and state government will not be the solution to all our problems, 10 million people working together is the key."
R,I am inspired by the fact that Mayor Bing and Mayor Heartwell can join us today.
R,We need to put party and geography aside and come together as Michiganders to reinvent our state.
R,I wasn’t’ hired to just be the governor of state government.
R,I was hired to be governor of the entire state of Michigan.
R,We must all come together to achieve success.
R,"It is time to stop fighting among ourselves, it is time to solve problems and create opportunities."
R,It is also time to be bold.
R,I’ve been cautioned by many that expectations are already too high.
R,"We shouldn’t walk away from high expectations, it is time to deliver on high expectations."
R,We need to stop accepting the status quo.
R,"Now, I want to share one story with you, one of our success stories in this state —Mike and Stacy Marsh."
R,They started as entrepreneurs.
R,"They started two sandwich shops in the Ann Arbor area, yogurt and sandwich."
R,And they were successful.
R,But they had high expectations.
R,They didn’t stop there.
R,"When they looked at their sandwich business they realized there was anopportunity to innovate, with bread."
R,"So they not only made sandwiches, they started making bread."
R,"They innovated on a 10,000-year-old product."
R,And today they have created an organization called Flatout Bread that is selling tens of millions of dollars ofbread every year.
R,That’s the kind of role model in our state.
R,"And I want to thank and congratulate Mike and Stacy, they are here today on their success."
R,You are the role model for the future.
R,Because they sent us two clear messages: With high expectations you can achieve great results.
R,"Also importantly with respect to innovation, we have to remember, innovation is not about technology, it’s a state of mind that we all have the power to do."
R,"For the reinvention of Michigan going ahead, at a minimum we need to commit to the four following objectives: Number one, we will be a globally competitive leader in innovation."
R,"Number two, we will create more and better jobs."
R,"Number three, we will create a bright future for our young people."
R,"And finally, we will do this together, and not leave some behind."
R,Part of the process is to celebrate some of the great successes we have going for us.
R,"Over the next year you will hear of Power of Michigan events, to highlight great entrepreneurial and innovation activities in our state."
R,"We will highlight things we are already doing, things such as ArtPrize in Grand Raids, the Accelerate Michigan innovation contest in southeastern Michigan."
R,Michigan Tech’s institute for leadership and innovation up in Hougton.
R,"We have great things going, and we will celebrate them."
R,"We all want to live in a state of high expectations, and more importantly high results."
R,We can only achieve extraordinary things if we aspire beyond traditional thinking.
R,"The old, unbelievable needs to become the new achievable."
R,"New expectations for our lives, and the lives of our children."
R,Let today be the birth of a new chapter in Michigan’s history.
R,Let today be the birth of the era of innovation and the reinvention of Michigan.
R,Thank you and may God bless you and thegreat state of Michigan.
R,"Mr. Speaker, Madame President, honorable members of the House and Senate."
R,Chief Justice Lynn and honorable members of the Judiciary.
R,"Members of the Executive Council, Commissioners, and of course, my fellow Granite Staters that are joining us today, Happy New Year and Welcome.It’s an honor to be before you today and I want to begin by thanking you for placing your trust in me to serve as your Governor.I want to acknowledge a few people, without whom, none of this would be possible.My family: my kids, my parents and the one person who has sacrificed more than you can possibly imagine, but she does it because she really believes in the differences we are making, Valerie.And we can’t discuss sacrifice without taking a moment to remember all those who are right now standing post, away from their families, whether in country or abroad serving in our military."
R,"And their families and our Veterans who have given so much.It is THEIR sacrifices that allow us to enjoy the freedom to be here today.In November, the voters of our state set us on a path that requires that we, as state leaders, come together, embrace a spirit of cooperation, and work together to get things done for the people of New Hampshire."
R,"They deserve nothing less.We were sent to Concord to fix the problems, create opportunities, and to embrace the power of the individual."
R,"Make no mistake —we’ve made great progress these 
past two years but there’s a lot to be done to build on those successes.In just the last two years, we established full-day kindergarten, signed the most comprehensive child protection and welfare bills this state has ever seen, provided tax relief for small businesses, and with the implementation of the Hub and Spoke Model this very week, we have begun to lead and serve as a model for the nation in creating long term solutions for the Substance Use Disorder crisis.We worked together to keep the health care of 50,000 low income Granite Staters while instilling the dignity of employment and saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars."
R,"That’s the New Hampshire Way —designing innovative systems that put individuals first, giving them a chance to thrive.But when we look back on what we have accomplished, we cannot lose sight why we’re here.In Public Service, How you get there is just as important as the goals you achieve.New Hampshire is best when we work together, and that’s what we must do.Whether you are a Republican or Democrat, Independent or Libertarian —we all share a passion for making our communities the strongest they can be."
R,"A commitment to making sure that New Hampshire remains the best place to live, work, and raise a family.I have often said that we don’t let the dysfunction of Washington define our success here —and It’s true —politics does not dictate policy."
R,"We treat each other with respect and civility, not with the circus-like theatrics and zero-sum games that have taken over Washington.I traveled down to Washington a few weeks ago to spend some moments honoring and remembering one of America’s true heroes and public servants.President Bush’s passing was a reminder of the celebration of good public service."
R,"He was remembered for not just what he accomplished but how he did 
it."
R,"He treated people , as we say, the New Hampshire way —with respect, dignity, and compassion, even when disagreeing on policy."
R,We must continue to uphold that tradition and rise above negativity and partisanship.Public Service isn’t about going after funding.
R,And it’s not about picketing and protests.
R,It’s about bringing people together.
R,Getting out of your comfort zone to do the right thing.
R,"A very smart man once said “It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities”."
R,"And yes, that brilliant individual was Dumbledore from the Harry Potter books that actually said that, but it’s true."
R,It’s all about choices.I recently saw an interview with Adam Sandler.
R,A great NH native who when talking about his childhood said “I wasn’t a kid growing up thinking ‘One day I’ll get and Oscar and make a speech.
R,That wasn’t on my mind.” And I believe service to our citizens begins with management and customer service.
R,The goal should be to create an all-inclusive welcoming environment where people can serve NH’s citizens.
R,"To be able to say ‘This is who we are and how can we help.Therefore the obligation is on us to push the limits, think outside of the box, get out of our comfort zones and simply to do more."
R,It’s one of the reasons I have been known to partake in a variety of “experiences”.
R,"Whether it is jumping into the Atlantic Ocean in the middle of winter to bring awareness to the Opioid crisis, or repelling down the side of a 24 story building to raise money for the Granite United Way, or sleeping out on the streets of Manchester to raise money for the homeless."
R,It’s all part of highlighting the opportunities out there to be involved and help our communities.Now there is one moment I’d like to share from one of those adventures.
R,"As many people know Valerie and I are involved with Best Buddies, a great organization that creates social opportunities and friendships for kids with disabilities."
R,"Last year I put together a team to do a 50-mile bike ride for Best Buddies and two of those team mates that stepped up to join me were Christine Tappan, our new Assistant Commissioner of Human Services at DHHS, and Christine Brennan, the Deputy Commissioner of Education."
R,Opening doors and being able to work with anyone that can help us should be a primary axiom that we all carry as public servants.
R,"Whether it be a qualified nominee brought before the Executive Council, or a new hire to assist the state with the Opioid crisis, or our willingness to work with political friends or opponents, it shouldn’t matter as long as the public is being served."
R,I travel to Washington a lot to advocate for our state.
R,Many states pay to have their own lobbyists in DC.
R,I don’t.
R,I believe that no one can advocate for a state like the personalrelationships a governor can bring to the table.
R,"So I fly down from time to time and sit with Secretary’s, or the Administration or the President himself when necessary."
R,And I’m always baffled at those who would criticize for that but look at the results.
R,"Those personal relationship that we worked to develop ensured thatWhen the Manchester VA was in crisis, Secretary Shulkin was on the phone with me and responding within hours to send a team in to help.When there was a threat of drilling for oil off of our coastline, Secretary Zinke sat with me to give assurances it wouldn’t happen.When we discovered the Vocational Rehab funds were mismanaged and the program was going to have to close for those kids with disabilities, it was Betsy DeVos that sat with me and agreed to provide gap funding to keep the programs alive across the state.And when we had a new idea that needed significant funding for the Opioid crisis, I was able to hand a detailed plan to the President and his team and advocate forwhat would become the single biggest increase in Opioid funding in the country right here in NH."
R,"The list goes on, but I share these examples with you as a reminder that relationships matter and in public service Don’t burn bridges."
R,"You’ll 
be surprised how many times you have to cross the same river.There is no doubt New Hampshire is better off today than it was two years ago."
R,"We have the lowest poverty rate in the nation, business taxes are at their lowest in decades, and more people are working thanever before.But do not make the mistake of taking our successes for granted."
R,It wasn’t luck or happenstance that got us here.
R,"It was hard work, instilling sound economic principles, focusing on creating economic opportunities for individuals by providing employers across the state flexibility and financial opportunity that flows to the employees and their families."
R,In New Hampshire we have made a choice.
R,We don’t want businesses making more investment into Government.
R,We ask businesses to invest intheir employees.
R,And they do.
R,"Our neighbors in New England can’t make the same claim, which is one of the reasons they are losing younger workers and businesses are flocking to New Hampshire."
R,It is why we already have some of the highest household income on the country.
R,Our model is a success and we cannot afford to go backwards.
R,Tax relief is working.Lowering the cost of doing business through tax relief has allowed businesses to reinvest in their workforce.
R,"That is a key factor in New Hampshire seeing significant wage growth because when a business can retain more of its revenue, it is able to increase pay for employees."
R,Tax relief is a reason why more people are working in New Hampshire than ever before.Look at the data.
R,Revenues are rising.
R,"Costly regulations have been eliminated, and we are investing surplus funds into smart one-time investments.I implore this legislature to learn from the mistakes of the past."
R,The last thing we should be doing is raising taxes or pushing a budget that does not live within our means.
R,And it should go without saying -There will be no sales or income tax of any kind on my watch.And the state budget cannot and should not become a vehicle for political victories or policy-driven battles.
R,"The budget is a roadmap for responsible spending, not some partisan-driven political agenda."
R,Economically we sit as the envy of New England.
R,We must continue to build on that success.
R,"The Budget cannot turn into an ideological battle of wills that would end up hurting thecitizens we are sworn to serve.And I want to revisit the concept of surplus funds, because it is a key area."
R,Those are one-time funds that cannot and should not be spent on bigger government.
R,"That would only lead to long term liabilities we won’t be able to pay for down the road.Instead, look to the examples of last session:We did a one-time $30 Million investment into safe schools –the first of its kind in state history -over 500 schools received grants to make their schools safer."
R,"That is abig win for New Hampshire, especially our property taxpayers.We also returned over $35 million to cities and towns last year for critical infrastructure improvements."
R,"Every single town in the State of New Hampshire received a check for road repairs, bridge improvements, projects that otherwise would have been borne by property taxes.So stayed tuned."
R,"Next month, on Valentine’s Day, I will submit a state budget that keeps our commitment to protecting our thriving economy."
R,It will continue the currentschedule of business tax reductions.
R,It will use practical revenue estimates and ensure that we continue to make investments that will improve the lives of our citizens without jeopardizing our fiscal solvency.
R,"Instead of encouraging employment advancement, the current system incentivizes people to remain on state support."
R,"This might make some sense in the short term, but in the long term, we end up harming the people who often need the most help."
R,"Thisdynamic makes no sense.Working together, I believe we can create revenue neutral reforms to end the Cliff Effect in our state."
R,"We can provide more reasonable “off-ramps” that encourages the dignity of work in a way that saves, rather than costs, our taxpayers."
R,And gives those receiving benefits the greatest gift of economic stability –a good job that allows them independence and the ability to support their family.
R,"It won’t be easy but I believe the pathway is there, and I’m calling on the Legislature to join me in tackling the issue head-on.I want to take a moment to discuss a specific and serious public health issue here in New Hampshire-Pediatric Cancer.According to the Center of Disease Control —New Hampshire had the highest rate of pediatric cancer in the U.S. between 2003 and 2014.That is unacceptable, and we cannot allow this alarming trend to continue."
R,"We must work together to find answers, create solutions, and lead the way out of this crisis.So in my budget next month, I will use our surplus funds to commission a study to once and for all determine the extent of the crisis and provide solutions for our citizens."
R,This study will not have a partisan agenda or pre-conceived notions.
R,The mission is simple: figure out the truth and use data to develop sound policies that will help the children of our state.
R,"Answers will not come overnight, but starting today this crisis is a top priority of my administration and the state of New Hampshire.Another significant public health issue we are battling is of course the Opioid Crisis.Last year, as overdoses went up nationwide, New Hampshire bucked the national trend —and for the first time in years, our overdose rate is going down."
R,"A good 
sign but we know there’s a lot more work to do.This week New Hampshire’s Hub and Spoke Model opened its doors for the first time across the state, now known as ‘The Doorway’."
R,"This model will begin to take root and combined with our Recovery Friendly Workplace initiative and the newly fully funded Alcohol Fund, I have no doubt that we will continue to see our successes grow."
R,We have created more tools to use at our disposal than ever before.I want to take a moment and talk about Recovery Friendly Workplaces which hit a milestone last month.
R,"Through this program, we utilize the support of the business community to create workplaces that become part of an individual’s recovery."
R,"As of today 63 businesses, with over 40,000 employees, have signed up to join the initiative.We are taking whole new approaches to fighting addiction."
R,"Public sector, private sector, you name it."
R,We have innovative solutions and the country is taking notice.
R,"There’s still a lot of work to do but let’s stay focused and keeping building a system that wins this war.Just two short years ago, the Division for Children, Youth, and Families –DCYF –was in crisis."
R,We needed new management.
R,We needed more caseworkers.
R,We needed funding.
R,Children were at risk.So what did we do?
R,Turning around any operation begins with leadership.
R,"So first we brought in a world-class team, including the architect of New Jersey’s dramatic and successful turnaround of its child protection system."
R,It’s not often that New Hampshire looks to New Jersey for best practices but they are the gold standard andour system should be nothing less.Then we put politics aside and brought everyone to the table so the best ideas could be implemented.
R,"And as a result, huge strides were made in reforming DCYF, and we passed the single most comprehensive child protection bill this state had ever seen.We restored critical voluntary prevention programs, so the families in trouble 
today do not turn into families in crisis tomorrow.We added over 30 new caseworkers and got funding where it needed to be.Bipartisan work is possible, and it can be done."
R,"But again, let’s not rest on those successes, there’s more work to do."
R,"This year, let’s fill those open positions at the agency, work to attract more the best advocates for these kids and ensure our system never goes down that difficult path again.Along those same lines, I also believe we must reform our foster care system."
R,We must ensure that the welfare and safety of children is preeminent.
R,We must be their advocates and we will continue to stand up for them.
R,"Thisis who we were sent here to fight for: the vulnerable, the forgotten, the kids who through tragic circumstances and no fault of their own need us to help give them a fighting chance, an opportunity.Good families are the foundation of a healthy communities."
R,"And therefore, we must ensure that our system is one that attracts and retains those caring families who extend their homes and hearts to foster children."
R,"And once we retain them, let’s get governmental bureaucracy out of their way so they can focus their attention on the children and not waste their time dealing with paperwork."
R,We must do more to support them.
R,"And we will.These past two years we have made meaningful, sustained progress in addressing is our state’s mental health crisis."
R,"For too long, it was the unspoken crisis of this state.When something is clearly not working, you don’t just keep pushing harder in the same direction, you don’t just keep pouring taxpayer dollars into a broken system—you must have the courage to change direction."
R,"And that is what we did.We started by engaging those on the front lines, the stakeholders and providers."
R,"And today in New Hampshire, --as a result of their feedback –we are rebuilding and re-engineering the entire mental health system, and now arein greater compliance with the Community Mental Health Agreement than ever 
before.We added mobile crisis teams —which help divert individuals away from hospital emergency departments, and allow them to be stabilized in their own communities.We added 40 additional community residential beds with wrap-around services which will support individuals leaving New Hampshire Hospital.But while we have made great strides the past two years to rebuild that system there is more work to do."
R,In the coming weeks we will be releasing a new 10 Year Mental Health Plan.
R,"A practical roadmap to quality mental health care.And this year, we will accomplish something frankly it has taken far too long to achieve -We WILL move the State Psychiatric Unit out of the State Prison and treat our patients with the dignity they deserve.You cannot discuss reforms within our mental health system without acknowledging the issue of suicide in our state."
R,We know that suicide affects far too many of our communities.
R,Too many lives are taken from us far too soon.Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people in New Hampshire.
R,"And while there is no single answer, there is more we can do.Talking about suicide is difficult —It’s heartbreaking."
R,"But sometimes, all it takes is one conversation to save a life.A family from Boscawen, the Dickey’s, know the pain of suicide more than anyone every should have to."
R,"Just over a year ago, Paul and Martha Dickey’s son, Jason Dickey, took his own life.I met the Dickey’s at a FIRST Robotics competition over at UNH."
R,"And the story they told me was one where they are channeling their pain into hope, for all of us.Today, I am proud to announce my support for legislation that Martha and Paul brought to me —it’s called the Jason Flatt Act —named after yet another victim of 
suicide, who took his own life in 1997.Under the Jason Flatt Act teachers in New Hampshire will complete 2 hours of youth suicide awareness and prevention training each year."
R,"Through the support ofthe Jason Foundation, this training can be provided at no cost to the state or local school districts.We must understand that suicide is preventable, and it starts with us.Today, 20 states have passed this law, and it is time New Hampshire join that list.It goes without saying that students are experiencing new and more intense kinds of stress both inside and outside of the classroom."
R,"Helping students with the skills needed to successfully manage that stress, how to understand and manage their emotions, cultivate empathy and develop positive relationships is critical to keeping that student out of crisis or a mental health challenge.Scarlett Lewis works nationally to promote social and emotional learning (SEL) in schools through her Choose Love Enrichment Program."
R,It provides educators with free learning tools through the 12th grade.
R,"Scarlett is the mother of Jesse, who was killed in his classroom during the tragedy at Sandy Hook in 2012."
R,She is another wonderful example of someone using the power of the individual to make positive change.
R,We put an emphasis on SEL learning last year.
R,"My administration has been going to schools all around our state, explaining why this programming is so important."
R,Several schools have stepped up to be leaders by example.
R,One such school district is Inter-Lakes.
R,"Not only have they stepped up to be a leader for their schools, but they also want to be among the first to implement the program in an amazing community-wide model."
R,"Parents, teachers, counselors, resource officers, and school administrators have all welcomed this program with excitement and as a result, I am so proud to report that as of today, the Choose Love program is in over 200 schools in New Hampshire and I want to personally thank Scarlett whois joining us today for making this a reality in New Hampshire."
R,"Thank you!There is so much possibility when it comes to untapped potential in our 
classrooms."
R,"New Hampshire’s exceptional public education system can proudly boast to have some of the best teachers, administrators and schools in the nation.Getting education right will go a long way to maintaining our state’s prosperity."
R,"It means more jobs for more Granite Stater’s, less reliance on federal and state services, higher incomes and healthier citizens."
R,"There is no reason New Hampshire should not be the model for the rest of the nation when it comes to education.Over the past biennium, we have increased education grant programs to New Hampshire public schools by almost $50 million.I fully expect this legislature will have a rigorous and thorough discussion regarding funding for education."
R,And I will be there with you in that important conversation.
R,But it would be shortsighted to think that funding is the only discussion needed regarding education.We have big opportunities to expand a student’s access to educational choices.
R,"We must provide additional pathways for students to harness their ability to learn.Last year, I advocated for and signed legislation to expand the number of outside the classroom experiences and activities that can satisfy a graduation requirement."
R,The “Learn Everywhere” initiative is a recognition that a 21 Century education system is not found only within the four walls of a classroom.Consider a student who loves performing arts and participates in a local Boys and Girls Club performing arts program.
R,That the Boys and Girls Club can now enroll its theater arts program as an approved ‘Learn Everywhere’ program.
R,"Once approved, that student now can receive high school credit for that program."
R,This frees up the student’s time to pursue other academic interests or free up time to take advantage of a dual or concurrent enrollment program.
R,"This is a huge win for students.In keeping with that principle, I am proud to announce today the creation of ‘New Hampshire Career Academies’."
R,"Working with our community college system existing funds, our students can take advantage of an optional fifth year of high school that will be enable them to receive a high school diploma, a certificate and a College Associates Degree free of cost to the student."
R,"It also comes with something else, a guaranteed interview with a New Hampshire company for a job right here in 
the Granite State.This revolutionary idea for the New Hampshire Career Academy is the result of the good work of Dean Graziano, of the Rochester School District."
R,Dean put together the program with the Great Bay Community College for Rochester high school seniors.
R,"It has put interested students on a career pathway with one of Rochester’s premiere employers, Albany/Saffron.It also has to possibility of achieving what so far has eluded so many –a model that does not cost the taxpayers or the education system ANY additional money but makes a free college degree available to NewHampshire students.This innovative initiative is a win for students, parents and taxpayers."
R,"I want to thank Commissioner Edelblut for his hard work in helping to develop this exciting opportunity for New Hampshire’s students.Both initiatives I’ve just discussed underscore an important principle, government is not the solution to every problem, but government can help ensure that the doors of opportunity are open at every level.When I took office, it was my firm belief that the Government should beabout empowering individuals, not just institutions."
R,"Just two years ago, I stood before you, and proposed the Governors Scholarship Program."
R,The Governors Scholarship did exactly that.
R,"We invested in students directly so they could choose the path best suited for them, Community College, University System, Public, Private whatever the best path was, it was their choice.In its first year close to 600 students from across New Hampshire received Governor’s scholarships to attend NH schools with the programanticipated to expand 20% next year, it’s simply more opportunity for our kids.I want to take a moment a brag a bit about my amazing wife."
R,One of the many brilliant ideas that Valerie has had to help bring people together was to really open up the Bridges House to make it a gathering place of ideas.
R,She calls it “Building Bridges at the Bridges”.
R,"It’s been wonderful to be able to bring in non-profits, 
organizations and just regular citizens to be integrated in what’s happening in the state."
R,And as many of you know as a former school teacher she’s been very passionate about bring students and initiatives together.
R,One of those is Project Green Schools.
R,"It’s a national program that awards grants to student-driven environmental projects.And on one afternoon, student groups from across the state came to the Bridges house and did a sort of “shark-tank” style presentation for a panel of us that judged the projects and awarded grants supported by corporate partners of the project."
R,"We had a project presented from a young girl to help reduce the amount of paper used in the classroom, a team from Portsmouth high school that was building their own outdoor learning space, there were a few others and it was great."
R,It was great to see the innovation and initiative these students took.
R,"Not just for the sake of doing a project, but with real thought of the costs, outcomes and benefits."
R,The How’s and Why’s of each project and I thought it was a wonderful testament to our schools.
R,You all know how passionate I am about energy policy in our state and how intertwined energy policy is with environmental policy.
R,"When you have some of the highest rates of electricity in the country, this issue must be at the forefront as it effects every citizen stuck paying a bill."
R,"It’s why we need to continue supporting an ‘All of the Above’ energy portfolio, as outlined in the state’s 10 year energy strategy.I have always said we should view energy policy through the lens of the ratepayer."
R,"And I hear a lot of talk from legislators that say YES, they will fight for lower electric rates, but then vote for legislation that raises rates and burden our citizens."
R,You can’t have it both ways.
R,"If you want to talk about lowering rates than support legislation that does just that.It is the most vulnerable among us, seniors and individuals on fixed incomes, that are at the greatest risk of high electric rates.I think it is time that we refocus our efforts on them, and I am advocating today that renewable energy initiatives shouldbenefit low income ratepayers first and foremost."
R,"Whether it’s solar, or wind, or battery storage, we need to ensure that the 
benefits of these well-intentioned programs deliver results to the people who are struggling to pay the bill each month."
R,"While other states have unfortunately decided to put developers’ interests ahead of ratepayers, in New Hampshire we must put the people first.We don’t need to further raise electricity rates and tax our citizens to be good environmental stewards, we just need to be smarter about how we spend the money we have."
R,"When talking about climate policy, we must take a three-pronged-approach."
R,"We must look at the environmental, economic, and social aspect of any policy."
R,"We must be smart and responsible, and we must be willing to look at new ideas.The Office of Strategic Initiatives and Public Utility Commission are currently working out a plan for the multi-million-dollar Clean Energy Fund which is being made available this year."
R,I want to see renewable energy projects for low income families and communities to be a priority for those investment dollars.
R,Let’s make sure those that bear the brunt of the costs of renewable energy are the first in line to receive the economic benefits.New Hampshire has sent us here to Concord to deliver results.
R,"There will be times when we will disagree, without a doubt, but let’s do so in a way that is free from and personal attacks and unnecessary political rhetoric."
R,"We are here for a greater purpose, to represent the needs of our constituents, disagree respectfully, focus on moving forward in areas where we can find common ground.And it isn’t always easy, it takes constant vigilance to see some of these tougher issues to the end, but we all have to be up to the task."
R,"Thank you so very much for allowing me the honor to serve as your Governor.Let’s keep up the momentum we’ve built over the past two years.Let’s keep serving as an example of bipartisan cooperation for the entire country, andLet’s get to work."
R,"God bless you, and God bless the great State of New Hampshire.Thank you."
R,"Mr. President, Madam Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests and fellow Vermonters: 

I want to begin by thanking the people of Vermont for the opportunity to serve as Governor, and for their trust and support as we carry out the work ahead."
R,It is the greatest honor of my life.
R,"I also want to thank my wife, Diana, my two daughters, Erica and Rachael, my mom and my entire family for their support and love—I couldn’t do this without you."
R,This is the second time I’ve had the privilege of addressing you as we open the biennial session.
R,"Each time, we’ve gone about our work against the backdrop of a national political environment that’s brought out the worst in the public process."
R,"Unfortunately, this still exists today, as too many value political points over policy solutions."
R,"Social media still overflows with negativity and hate, and politics as a whole still seems to divide us more than it brings us together."
R,"I truly believe that in Vermont, we can set a standard that others across the nation can aspire to­, and elected officials can look to, as a better way—the right way—to go about the work of the people."
R,"And when the work gets difficult, when tensions build—which they will—when divisions seem too deep to overcome, when we need to be reminded that there’s still good in the world—look no further than the people of Vermont."
R,We saw the good in the people of Swanton who sheltered and fed their neighbors as flood waters forced them from their homes in the depths of winter.
R,The good lives in the young girls and boys who were inspired when they saw Montpelier native Amanda Pelkey take the ice half-way around the world in South Korea.
R,"When she was born, hockey was a game for boys."
R,"Twenty-five years later, we welcomed Amanda home, an Olympic gold medalist."
R,"The good is in the pride hundreds of us felt, on a cold day in November, to celebrate the return of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, and the incredible work of two Vermont artists, Jerry Williams and Chris Miller, whose craftmanship will stand for generations on top of this beautiful building."
R,"The good is in Sara Byers, the owner of Leonardo’s Pizza in Burlington, giving those in recovery the opportunity to get back to work, knowing full well the road may be rough, but believing in the person—and the journey—and seeing past the stigma of addiction."
R,"The good is found in the Perry family, whose combined 120 years of dedication and service in the Navy was recognized at a shipyard in Groton, Connecticut as the USS Vermont was christened."
R,"Four sons, three grandsons and a granddaughter-in-law, all following in the footsteps of the former Representative from Richford, Captain Al Perry."
R,"We saw the good in two political opponents running for the House in Lamoille County, Lucy Rogers and Zac Mayo, a Democrat and a Republican debating the issues then sitting together to play a musical duet, proving to the nation there is a better way."
R,"Every day, we see the good in our servicemen and women and our first responders, our teachers and nurses, in our coaches, scout leaders, mentors and all those who serve others without expectation of praise, and often too little recognition."
R,The good is in this chamber.
R,It’s here because it lives in each and every one of our communities.
R,The places we come from and the people we go home to.
R,"It’s in our schools and churches, our businesses and farms, our forests, trails and town halls."
R,"The good, the courage to show a better path, is the same courage that allowed those who came before us to persevere through harsh winters, to carve our way of life from granite mountains and rocky hillside pastures."
R,"The good is in our hearts, it’s in our minds and it’s who we’ve always been."
R,"Today, more than ever, it’s who America needs us to be."
R,"And to meet the challenges ahead, to best serve Vermonters, it’s who we have to be."
R,Our focus must remain on those we’re working for and what we’re working towards.
R,"To do that, we must face the economic realities that exist across the state, in all 251 towns, cities and villages, and the impact our policies have on each of them."
R,"We must look for common ground instead of highlighting or exploiting our differences, view consensus and compromise not as a weakness, but as a strength."
R,"And if we can, our work, our actions and our results will inspire a renewed faith in government and give hope to every community."
R,"Together, we can work toward a more prosperous future for our state and her people."
R,Where families in every town are moving up the economic ladder with a good-paying job and a way of life they can afford.
R,"Where all kids get a quality education, with the same opportunity, to achieve their full potential."
R,"And where we do all we can to provide for our neighbors who need us most, when they need us most."
R,"An affordable Vermont, with opportunity and economic growth, with great schools in every corner of the state and policies that benefit all Vermonters."
R,This can be our legacy.
R,"We can achieve this vision, but it requires us to recognize and overcome the obstacles in our way."
R,"I know some may be tired of hearing me talk about our demographics—or have given up and believe there’s nothing we can do to change them—while others may not feel a sense of urgency, because their own community hasn’t been impacted as dramatically as others."
R,"But you don’t have to take my word for it: just ask Moody’s, who recently downgraded our bond rating, in part, due to our lack of population growth, resulting in fewer working-age Vermonters."
R,These facts and this problem can no longer be ignored.
R,Just take our labor force as an example.
R,"Since 2009, our labor force has declined by about 15,000."
R,"15,000 fewer people working or looking for work."
R,"15,000 fewer Vermonters available for jobs we know businesses are trying to fill right now."
R,"15,000 fewer potential income tax payers."
R,These losses have been felt across the state but have had the greatest impact outside of Chittenden County.
R,"Since their peak employment, Washington and Franklin Counties have seen a labor force decline of about two percent."
R,"By the same measure, Addison and Orange have seen a reduction of nearly five percent, and Grand Isle and Orleans have lost around six."
R,"Bennington, Lamoille and Windham have seen their labor force shrink by 10 percent."
R,In Windsor: 12; Caledonia: 13; Rutland: 14.
R,"And in Essex, it’s down by almost 20 percent."
R,This demographic reality is perhaps most apparent in our schools—it’s like the canary in the mineshaft.
R,"In our public schools, we’re now educating about 30,000 fewer K-12 students than we were in 1997—that’s an average loss of three students a day for over 20 years."
R,And that trend continues.
R,There’s not a single county that hasn’t been affected.
R,Since 2004—which wasn’t all that long ago— Franklin County’s enrollment has shrunk by 3.5 percent—and is doing the best by far.
R,"Chittenden, Lamoille and Orange counties have seen declines of 12 percent."
R,"Enrollment has dropped by over 16 in Caledonia County, 17 percent in Orleans and nearly 19 in Washington."
R,"In Bennington and Grand Isle, it’s declined by 21 percent; in Windham: 23."
R,"Three counties—Addison, Rutland and Windsor—have lost a quarter of their students in 14 years."
R,"And in Essex, they’re educating 42 percent fewer kids."
R,These declines are eroding quality and opportunity for our children.
R,And this is happening on our watch.
R,"These trends not only mean fewer in our workforce and schools, but fewer customers at businesses, ratepayers for utilities, fewer available for our volunteer fire departments and others who support the needs of our communities."
R,"And fewer to share the costs of state government, with ongoing needs in areas like transportation, building maintenance, public safety and human services."
R,But there are other needs as well.
R,We have a moral obligation to protect our seniors and kids and treat those impacted by mental illness or addiction.
R,"We’re committed to restoring and protecting our lakes and rivers, which will cost Vermonters nearly $1 billion over the next 20 years."
R,And we must keep the promises we made to our state employees and teachers to pay their pensions and healthcare costs in full.
R,The debt we owe today is over $4 billion and the annual payment to catch up continues to grow by tens of millions each year.
R,But let’s be clear: A deal’s a deal.
R,"Each of these commitments are important, but our stagnant population is threatening every service we deliver, every program we administer and every investment we hope to make."
R,Even the most optimistic among us must recognize what this means.
R,"Without a different approach or major change in circumstances, our current revenues won’t support our obligations, our wants or even our needs."
R,"On the campaign trail, a Burlington business owner told me, “We don’t need more taxes—we need more taxpayers.”

The solution is really that simple, but the path to a better outcome requires our best ideas, our best work and the courage to make real change."
R,That’s what we signed up for and what’s expected of each of us.
R,"Vermonters elected me, and many of you, to ensure we don’t ask them to shoulder any more of the tax burden."
R,They’re doing their part.
R,It’s time for us to do ours.
R,"Despite these challenges, we have so much to offer and so much to be hopeful for."
R,"We’re one of the safest, healthiest states in the country."
R,"We have a good education system, which I believe we can make the very best, and we have a culture and lifestyle that is second to none."
R,"These things offer a great quality of life, which is among the best recruitment tools we could ask for."
R,"This is all positive, but we know it’s not enough."
R,"So, this session, let’s focus on strengthening those assets to keep and attract more working families, with an eye on reversing our population trends."
R,"Let’s grow the economy to support jobs and organic growth, expand our tax base and ease the burden on hard-working Vermonters, because if we want people to both move here and stay, we must make it more affordable."
R,"This is how we rise above the challenges ahead of us, improve the lives of Vermonters and chart a new course for our future."
R,"First, let’s work to reinforce the things that make Vermont such a great place to live: The health of our citizens and environment and the strength and safety of our communities."
R,Vermont has one of the lowest uninsured rates in the nation.
R,"We rank among the top states for the health of our women and children, the number of mental health providers and physical activity."
R,"We’re also among the best in the country with low instances of violent crime, obesity and infant mortality."
R,"Many of you in this room, as well as our predecessors, have contributed to this success."
R,"But Vermonters still struggle with the high cost of insurance, especially those in our state marketplace."
R,"That’s why I’ll propose health insurance reforms focused on increasing affordability for Vermonters and, specifically, young people, as we work to retain and attract more of them."
R,"And during the campaign, I talked about a voluntary paid family leave plan, balancing the value of this benefit with Vermonters’ ability to pay."
R,"In the coming weeks, I’ll roll out that concept."
R,I truly believe an opt-in approach puts us on a path to the goal that we all share without raising a new tax.
R,"We can also build on our work to protect our environment, communities and kids."
R,"We rank high when it comes to air quality, but we can do more to lower emissions in our state, so I’ll propose using settlement funds to help more Vermonters purchase electric vehicles."
R,"And my budget will propose a long-term funding source for our water quality initiatives, using existing revenues and a new delivery model to put this money to work on the ground."
R,"This fall, we learned from the Department of Health that some students may be exposed to lead in drinking water in our schools."
R,"Here’s an area we agree on, so let’s act quickly to protect our kids."
R,"In order to do that, my budget will invest in lead testing at schools statewide."
R,"And, if you’ll work with me in budget adjustment, we’ll have every school tested within a year."
R,"Second, we’ll continue to transform our education system, going from good to the very best in the country, supporting and educating every child from cradle to career."
R,Many of us here today have heard countless debates about education but far too often it’s been about something other than the kids themselves.
R,"From tax payers to teachers, the fate of buildings and debt, old districts and new districts and rates and rebates."
R,This has created a fear of change that’s handcuffed us to the status quo and distracted from the single most important purpose of our schools: educating our kids.
R,We must have the courage to make the conversation about giving every child the best possible chance at a good future.
R,And the truth is: not all of them are getting equal opportunities.
R,"Here is just one example of what students are facing:

Now, I want to be clear: these are real middle schools in Vermont, but I’m going to call them School A and School B."
R,"Students at each are taught language arts, math, science and social studies."
R,But School A has advanced math like Algebra I.
R,School B does not.
R,School A has 20 sections of art.
R,School B has one.
R,School A offers multiple French classes.
R,School B doesn’t have any foreign languages.
R,"School A has band, chorus, music, health education, industrial arts and family and consumer sciences."
R,School B doesn’t offer a single one of these.
R,You might be surprised to hear that these aren’t schools from opposite ends of the state.
R,These two middle schools feed into the very same high school.
R,"This is not an isolated case: It’s happening across Vermont, so we must continue to address the inequality that exists."
R,I’ve heard you and believe me: I recognize that change of this magnitude takes time.
R,"But in the near term, I believe the best opportunity for progress is in early care and learning—to give all kids, regardless of their background, a strong foundation."
R,We’ve taken important steps.
R,Let’s build on it this year by working together to give every child an equal chance at success.
R,"Last fall, I identified a new revenue source to put toward these initiatives, which I’ll detail in my budget address."
R,If we can work together on a high-quality child care system that’s affordable and accessible—along with a stronger education system—we could set Vermont apart from other states as an education destination for families.
R,"We can, and will, debate on policy—and that’s ok—but let’s focus on the merits of our ideas."
R,Let’s not resort to scare tactics.
R,"Let’s roll up our sleeves and make change that gives all our kids an equal shot at success, that puts their interests above special interests, and builds them—hands down—the best cradle-to-career education system in the country."
R,"Next, we must ensure businesses can stay competitive with those in other states around our region."
R,"Because we can put all the best ideas on the table to attract young people and support working families, but if we don’t have jobs, none of it will matter."
R,Act 250 was created nearly 50 years ago to address a rapidly growing state.
R,"At that time, there wasn’t the regulatory oversight to deal with the population expansion brought on by the baby boom and the interstate highway system."
R,But those circumstances no longer exist.
R,That’s why I’ll propose reforms to modernize Act 250 in a way that expands growth in our struggling downtowns while continuing to protect the environment.
R,We can and must do both.
R,This proposal builds on work we did together last term to modernize regulation and support the development of affordable housing in our downtowns and growth centers.
R,"This year, we can do even more to build stronger communities by updating Act 250 and encourage more compact development while preserving our working lands and rural character."
R,"We also know that broadband is crucial to parts of the state that are currently under-served or, in some cases, not connected at all."
R,"I’m sure most realize this isn’t the cure-all to our economic challenges, but as we seek to attract more people to live and work in Vermont, we must continue to expand access."
R,"This session, I’ll put forward a package of reforms, and my budget will include investments, to do just that."
R,"As I travel the state, I see places struggling to survive, many a shadow of what they used to be."
R,We’ve reached a point where too many are not growing—they’re shrinking.
R,"Whether you’re here from Readsboro or Alburgh, Island Pond, Richford, Springfield, Newport or any one of the proud communities that helped write Vermont’s economic history but now face tough times, know this: I’m eager to work with each of you to develop policies to revitalize all 14 counties and to ensure that hope and opportunity exists not only in Burlington, but in Brattleboro, Bennington, Berkshire, Barton and all 251 towns across our state."
R,"Finally, we need to do a better job leveraging our assets, the things that make Vermont a great place to visit, work and live."
R,"Consider this: In 2017, the top towns for millennial home buyers were not New York City, Boston or San Francisco."
R,"They were Williston, North Dakota, Athens, Ohio and Aberdeen, South Dakota."
R,Millennials appear willing to put affordability and quality of life over the conveniences and attractions of our biggest cities when buying a home.
R,"I believe Vermont can offer what they’re looking for, and in many instances, we already do."
R,"The work we did last term in the areas of housing, education, downtown development and workforce training, while striving to make Vermont more affordable, were positive steps forward."
R,But we must do more.
R,We know availability of affordable housing is a huge barrier to recruiting young workers—I hear it every day from employees and employers.
R,"Last term, we worked together to create more housing Vermonters can afford."
R,Let’s build on that progress by focusing on existing stock and rental units.
R,My budget will propose a package focused on growing the housing supply by revitalizing properties and investing in existing neighborhoods.
R,"These are steps in the right direction, but it’s not enough to simply offer things that appeal to young people and working families."
R,We must do a better job telling our story and use it to aggressively recruit new Vermonters.
R,"Even if you believe Vermont is perfect, it’s clear we aren’t doing enough to persuade people to move and stay here."
R,"Last year, thanks to innovative thinking from the Legislature, we launched a program offering incentives to remote workers who moved here."
R,"Just passing this law gained international media attention, and as a result, nearly 3,000 people inquired about the program."
R,This showed us a couple of things.
R,"First, publicity works."
R,"And second, people do have an interest in moving here but sometimes just need a reason to take that first step."
R,That’s why my budget will again propose a labor force expansion package that targets those likely to move and a regional sales team approach to close the deal.
R,"I hope you’ll join me in supporting this effort, because investing to grow our workforce is one of the single most important things we can do for our economy and to reduce the tax burden on those here now."
R,"This fall, I visited employees at Eden Ciders in West Charleston."
R,My team heard they’ve had success recruiting young workers to relocate here and we wanted to learn more.
R,I asked them why they chose Vermont.
R,Most said they liked the sense of community we offer.
R,"Many also thought it was a good place to raise a family, while some came for outdoor recreation."
R,"While there, someone shared that Precision Composites in Lyndonville wasn’t having any trouble filling positions—even engineers."
R,"Now, that got my attention."
R,"Because just the week before, I was at Collins Aerospace in Vergennes and they said they were looking to hire 25 engineers but were struggling to do so."
R,What was the secret in the Northeast Kingdom?
R,They put a “help wanted” ad in a mountain biking magazine.
R,The point is we know people want to come here.
R,We just need to identify and reach those who do.
R,"Collectively, we have a lot of good ideas, so let’s act on them together."
R,"Let’s build the best education system in the country and nurture a business climate that keeps and creates good jobs, so we can better compete with other states."
R,Let’s think creatively about attracting more workers and families so we have the revenue to better serve the Vermonters already here.
R,Let’s support policies and make investments that will work towards these goals and do so without digging further into the pockets of Vermonters.
R,"Because to build the future we want for our kids and their kids, we must ensure Vermont’s affordable."
R,"While our challenges are great, when we work together, we can do great things."
R,Over the last two years our record speaks for itself.
R,"To improve efficiency and better serve Vermonters, we merged the Departments of Liquor and Lottery, a long-standing goal for some legislators in this room."
R,"And we did the same in creating the Agency of Digital Services, which has saved taxpayers about $4 million since its creation."
R,"With your leadership, we supported foster parents and crime victims, strengthened consumer protections and are working to make prescription drugs more affordable."
R,We modernized our licensing laws to expand the pool of drug treatment professionals and make it easier for members of the military to enter the civilian workforce.
R,"When actions in Washington put access to healthcare in jeopardy, Speaker Johnson, Senator Ashe, Republican party leaders from both houses and I stood with Senators Leahy and Sanders and Congressman Welch to protect Medicaid funding."
R,Where else but Vermont would you see such a politically-diverse group joining together to defend access to healthcare?
R,And for two years we didn’t raise a single tax or fee in the General Fund.
R,"We also held statewide residential property tax rates level, while fully funding school budgets passed by local voters."
R,We removed the tax on social security for low- and middle-income Vermonters and worked to revitalize downtowns and villages throughout the state.
R,"We made the single largest investment in housing the state has ever seen, as well as a 70 percent increase in clean water funding and opened a treatment center in St. Albans that helped eliminate long waitlists statewide, allowing more Vermonters to start on a path to recovery."
R,"We did all this, and so much more, by working together."
R,"It wasn’t always easy or comfortable, but hard work—good work—is rarely either of these things."
R,"And we need more of it because the solutions we seek—in the political environment in which history has placed us—requires that above all else, we focus on what it means to be true public servants."
R,"When announcing his retirement in 2005, Senator Jim Jeffords said, “In no other job do you have both the freedom and the obligation to solve problems and help people on a daily basis.”

Solve problems and help people."
R,A simple concept and an important reminder of why we’re here.
R,As partisanship and division have eroded the trust many have in our democracy; as conflict captures headlines far more often than the good work we’ve done to strengthen Vermont; and as reports of our disagreements overshadow all we agree on and the progress we’ve made working together—let’s solve problems and help people.
R,That's our job.
R,It’s our responsibility.
R,It’s what our neighbors who elected us expect.
R,It’s what the challenges we’re here to confront demand of us.
R,"And most importantly, it’s what Vermonters deserve."
R,"As we open this new biennium, with the hope and promise of a new year, let’s commit to this work; put aside our differences to work together, to come together."
R,To solve problems and help people each and every day.
